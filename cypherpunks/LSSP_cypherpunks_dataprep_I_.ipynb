Whitaker\")\\nDate: Mon, 21 Sep 1992 13:24:27 +0000\\nSubject: Long but good: Hammill on encryption\\nMessage-ID: <717081867snx@eternity.demon.co.uk.demon.co.uk>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nThe following is the text of a *very* interesting speech\\ngiven in 1987 by mathematician Chuck Hammill.  The Soviet\\nUnion is mentioned; while this may be a little dated, there\\'s\\nalways China... and Cuba... and a few other places...\\n\\nEnjoy,\\n\\nRussell\\n\\n\\n\\n  FROM CROSSBOWS TO CRYPTOGRAPHY:  THWARTING THE STATE VIA\\n                     TECHNOLOGY\\n \\n  Given at the Future of Freedom Conference, November 1987\\n \\n \\n     You   know,   technology--and   particularly   computer\\ntechnology--has often gotten a bad rap in  Libertarian  cir-\\ncles.  We tend to think of Orwell\\'s 1984, or Terry Gilliam\\'s\\nBrazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin\\'s\\nslave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-\\nphisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on\\nhis \"enemies list.\"  Or, we recognize that for the price  of\\na  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of\\nsound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by\\na  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-\\nlongings if it beeps.\\n \\n     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there\\nwere cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with\\nclubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for\\neavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.\\nThough  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the\\nevil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.\\n \\n     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-\\ning  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from\\nthose who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors\\nthe  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-\\nnot).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the\\nmerit  of  the  new(  over  the sluggish (who cling to time-\\ntested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-\\nscribe government bureaucracy than \"dull\" and \"sluggish\"?\\n \\n     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology\\nover tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable\\ncrossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably\\nand lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if\\nthat  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike\\nthe longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could\\nget  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no\\nformal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required\\nelaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to\\nachieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow\\ncould simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the\\narrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-\\nget.)\\n \\n     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights\\nlikely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government\\nsoldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was\\nplain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves\\nnot only against one another, but against their governmental\\nmasters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-\\npiercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the\\nmedieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\\nCrossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-\\ntively, for its unlawful possession.\\n \\n     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology\\nlike  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the\\nhandgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced\\nmachine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal\\nand inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45\\ncalled \"the equalizer.\"  A frail dance-hall hostess with one\\nin  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself\\nagainst the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-\\nments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the\\nrepeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  \"a  man  on\\nhorseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be\\ncaptured.\"  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon\\nflintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a\\ntrue one.\\n \\n     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher\\n(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-\\nalent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can\\nsuch  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one\\'s\\nown possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-\\nchange   information   over   an   insecure   communications\\nchannel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or\\nskywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously\\nmet  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-\\nputer, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY\\nX-MP  can\\'t  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should\\nbe economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-\\ncations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.\\nTechnology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it\\nwill  have  totally demolished government\\'s control over in-\\nformation transfer.\\n \\n     I\\'d like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-\\nics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is\\ncalled the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman\\nwho  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact\\nthat, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very\\nlarge  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the\\ntwo prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    \"Ex-\\ntremely\"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100\\ndigits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-\\neral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful\\ncomputer now in existence.\\n \\n     The  \"public\" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-\\nuct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-\\ntor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *\\n(q-1) + 1}.  The \"private\" part of the key consists  of  the\\nother factor  y.\\n \\n     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned\\ninto an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple\\nA=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer\\nis then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting\\ninteger is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver\\ndecrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y\\n(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always\\nyield the original number started with.\\n \\n     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why\\nit  is  called  \"public-key\"  cryptography,\"  is  that I can\\nopenly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while\\nkeeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me\\nan encrypted message, namely\\n                       x\\n                     a    (mod pq)  ,\\nbut only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking\\nwhat  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the\\nresult (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher\\nkeys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust\\neach other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-\\nchange  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and\\ndisseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining\\nthe secrecy of his own  y.\\n \\n     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a \"dig-\\nital signature,\" to enable one to authenticate the source of\\na given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,\\nI raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod\\nyour pq)  and send that.\\n \\n    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and\\nraise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my\\npq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and\\nsend this, then even after you have normally \"decrypted\" the\\nmessage,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you\\nthen raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result\\n(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-\\nginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I\\ncould have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret\\ny).\\n \\n     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-\\nday tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of\\npersonal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that\\nAmerican schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-\\nputers  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in\\nfact, because there are things computers can do  which  will\\ninterest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-\\ncisely these students who one generation hence will be going\\nhead-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the\\nSoviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to\\nteach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning\\nballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal\\ncomputer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying\\nmachine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of\\ntext,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this\\nweren\\'t threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the\\ncopy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but\\nunbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-\\ncessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few\\ncopying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-\\nsively than machine guns are in the United States.)\\n \\n     Now  the  \"conservative\" position is that we should not\\nsell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use\\nthem  in weapons systems.  The \"liberal\" position is that we\\nshould sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and\\ncooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don\\'t make the sale, there\\nwill certainly be some other nation willing to.\\n \\n     For my part, I\\'m ready to suggest that the  Libertarian\\nposition should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and\\nif  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn\\'t\\nwork load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over\\nMoscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-\\nscription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this\\nis not a position that has gained much support among members\\nof  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-\\nter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus\\'s characters, we\\nare political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a\\nparticular  goal may not look anything like what most people\\nwould consider a \"straight line.\"    Taking  a  long  enough\\nworld-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-\\nment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to\\nthe enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of\\nthe Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen\\nmissiles aimed at Moscow.\\n \\n     But  there\\'s  the rub:  A \"long enough\" world view does\\nsuggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the\\nsimply  stupid  will \"get what they deserve,\" but what\\'s not\\nimmediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being\\nkilled, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.\\n \\n    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-\\ntack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,\\nfunctioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to\\nhamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political\\ngradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have\\npatchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire\\nand spit.  The state not only taxes us to  \"feed  the  poor\"\\nwhile also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive\\nup food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-\\nsidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-\\ncrease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness\\nthe fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as\\npotentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years\\nago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy\\nrisked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase\\nwas called the \"moral equivalent of war\" and the Feds  swung\\ninto  action.    For the first time in American history, the\\nspeed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-\\ncame an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of\\noil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-\\ncan oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who\\nsell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our\\ngrossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that\\ngovernment  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has\\nlowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking\\nto raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,\\nwhat  can we call this except the \"moral equivalent of civil\\nwar--the government against its own people?\"\\n \\n     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-\\nine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to\\ncourt  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too\\ncheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be\\ncompelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it\\nbe punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?\\n \\n     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of\\nhundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we\\ncertainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of\\nstability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there\\nexists  almost  a  \"black  hole\"  effect in the evolution of\\nnation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-\\ndom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state\\nwarps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to\\nthe degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes\\nall but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen\\nin the area of so-called \"welfare\" payments.  When those who\\nsup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those\\nwhose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible\\nchoice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-\\ning  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go\\ndown to the nearest \"welfare\" office, find just  two  people\\non  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form\\na voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question\\nof who owns your life--and the fruits of your life\\'s labor.\\n \\n     So essentially those who love liberty need an \"edge\" of\\nsome  sort  if  we\\'re ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-\\nously  can\\'t  use  the  altruists\\'  \"other-directedness\"  of\\n\"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of\\na billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.\"\\nRecognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it\\nis nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today\\'s culture.\\nIf you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a\\n\"cause,\" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as\\nto  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue\\nworking--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy\\nto draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-\\npeal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or\\nlibertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight\\nand say something like, \"Listen, follow me as I enunciate my\\nnoble \"cause,\" contribute your money to support the \"cause,\"\\ngive  up  your  free  time  to  work for the \"cause,\" strive\\nselflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your\\nchildren are dead) maybe your children\\'s children will actu-\\nally  live under egoism\"--you\\'d all think I\\'d gone mad.  And\\nof course you\\'d be right.  Because the point I\\'m  trying  to\\nmake is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,\\nwhen, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it\\nprofitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only\\nthen.\\n \\n     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-\\ntical  action, I don\\'t believe that it is the only, nor even\\nnecessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing\\nfreedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the\\ninvestment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-\\ning  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all\\nforms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who\\'s in-\\nterested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them\\nunilaterally.\\n \\n     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to\\nthe Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-\\nready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with\\nthe saying, you might well feel that you\\'ve heard  it  often\\nenough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,\\nand moreover, that maybe you\\'re even tired of hearing it.  I\\nshall therefore repeat it now:\\n \\n     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him\\nfor a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him\\nfor a lifetime.\\n \\n     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of\\na  \"workfare\"  vs.  \"welfare\"  context;  namely, that if you\\ngenuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him\\nhow to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.\\nAnd of course this is true, if only because the next time he\\nis hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even\\nable to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how\\nto fish, he is completely self sufficient.\\n \\n     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order\\ncontent of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to\\nglean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it\\nagain.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist\\nslant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-\\ntivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry\\nbeggars as we may encounter.\\n \\n     But consider:\\n \\n     Suppose this Eskimo doesn\\'t know how to  fish,  but  he\\ndoes  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,\\nhave often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country\\nbecause  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and\\nthey ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose\\nthe  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering\\nfishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first\\nthing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type\\ncategorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise\\nthat  every  trade  must  have a \"winner\" and a \"loser;\" the\\nidea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the\\n\"expense\" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this\\nscenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-\\nthing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-\\nished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information\\n(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum\\ngame.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  \"law  of\\ndiminishing   returns,\"   the  \"first  and  second  laws  of\\nthermodynamics\"--all those \"laws\" which constrain our possi-\\nbilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that\\'s\\nanarchy!\\n \\n     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry\\nEskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his\\nnation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish\\ncontain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he\\ntells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and\\neven  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people\\'s\\nhealth to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing\\nadults.   Perhaps it is because citizens\\' bodies are thought\\nto be government property, and therefore it is the  function\\nof the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-\\nment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-\\nously extends to competent adults the \"benefits\" it provides\\nto children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,\\nall-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need\\nnot  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior\\nthought physically risky or morally \"naughty.\"  But, in  any\\ncase,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-\\nlates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of\\nhis was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of \"pos-\\nsession of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.\"\\n \\n     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely\\noppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an\\naffront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-\\nther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-\\nary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting\\nthis tyrant\\'s goal.  (Your rationale may be \"altruistic\"  in\\nthe   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or\\n\"egoistic\" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the\\noppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-\\nhaps even other motives.)\\n \\n     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to\\nyour \"cause,\" you\\'re not about to mount a military campaign,\\nor  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.\\nHowever, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-\\nformation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a\\nhundredfold.    I say \"literally,\" because for a fraction of\\nthe effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to\\nsmuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a\\nhundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-\\ngeted government, like present-day America, at least permits\\nopen  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-\\nstricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government\\nattempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then\\nyou will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write\\nyour  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to\\nyour mythical Eskimo\\'s public-key parameters.  But as far as\\nincreasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine\\nnonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others\\nre-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you\\nhave not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-\\neological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-\\ncided.  Recall Harry Browne\\'s dictum  from  \"Freedom  in  an\\nUnfree World\" that the success of any endeavor is in general\\ninversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-\\nsion is necessary to its fulfilment.\\n \\n     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has\\nbeen dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,\\nLincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .\\nKhadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped\\nby  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and\\nWozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-\\nvasive, and not nearly so bloody.\\n \\n     And  that\\'s  where  I\\'m  trying  to  take The LiberTech\\nProject.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-\\nslave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-\\nwork spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize\\nfreedom for ourselves.\\n \\n     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at\\npresent)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government\\nwants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-\\nture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-\\nple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor\\nwhen government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to\\ncommit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that\\nfact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.\\nThis law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but\\nit does indicate how government thinks.\\n \\n     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed\\npose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone\\nwho  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the \"underground\\nrailroad\" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as\\nthe sovereign government of the United States of America  at\\nthat time found the buying and selling of human beings quite\\nas  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-\\nlarly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to\\nferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,\\nalcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-\\nogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents\\nfor his \"crime\"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life\\nwhen  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this\\ndrug.\\n \\n     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-\\nconspirator  and pardoned felon . . . \"Let me make one thing\\nperfectly clear:\"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,\\nparticipate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no\\nmatter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid\\nsuch  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-\\ntional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological\\nprocesses,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane\\nor manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-\\ncensing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is\\nneeded  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-\\nself.\\n \\n     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and\\ndespair,  thinking,  \"Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of\\nthis State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian\\nbefore  I\\'ll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my\\ngoddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery\"--recognize\\nthat  such  is not the case.  There exist ways to make your-\\nself free.\\n \\n     If you wish to explore such techniques via the Project,\\nyou are welcome to give me your name and address--or a  fake\\nname  and  mail  drop, for that matter--and you\\'ll go on the\\nmailing list for my erratically-published newsletter.    Any\\nfriends  or acquaintances whom you think would be interested\\nare welcome as well.  I\\'m not even asking for stamped  self-\\naddressed envelopes, since my printer can handle mailing la-\\nbels and actual postage costs are down in the noise compared\\nwith  the  other  efforts  in getting an issue out.   If you\\nshould have an idea to share, or even a  useful  product  to\\nplug,  I\\'ll be glad to have you write it up for publication.\\nEven if you want to be the proverbial \"free rider\" and  just\\nbenefit  from  what others contribute--you\\'re still welcome:\\nEverything will be public domain; feel free to  copy  it  or\\ngive it away (or sell it, for that matter, \\'cause if you can\\nget  money  for  it while I\\'m taking full-page ads trying to\\ngive it away, you\\'re certainly entitled to  your  capitalist\\nprofit . . .)  Anyway, every application of these principles\\nshould make the world just a little freer, and I\\'m certainly\\nwilling to underwrite that, at least for the forseeable  fu-\\nture.\\n \\n     I  will leave you with one final thought:  If you don\\'t\\nlearn how to beat your plowshares into  swords  before  they\\noutlaw  swords,  then you sure as HELL ought to learn before\\nthey outlaw plowshares too.\\n \\n                                       --Chuck Hammill\\n \\n                                 THE LIBERTECH PROJECT\\n                                 3194 Queensbury Drive\\n                               Los Angeles, California\\n                                                 90064\\n                                          310-836-4157\\n\\n[The above LiberTech address was updated June 1992, with the\\n permission of Chuck Hammill, by:\\n\\nRussell Earl Whitaker                   whitaker@eternity.demon.co.uk\\nCommunications Editor                       71750.2413@compuserve.com\\nEXTROPY: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought         AMIX: RWHITAKER\\nBoard member, Extropy Institute (ExI)\\n[.sig revised 11 September 1992    ///    Send mail to eternity node]\\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nVersion: 2.0\\n\\nmQCNAiqwg10AAAEEAMVNMI766ljeuW01xqXKYYV5lmDPvb+6dCQK3m1iBQdan0no\\npm35j1DIRp3UJZogAe5eimsQg1TALDhTq310OZs9+L6B/HxeX3+4BadIDad4g+xI\\nlvaFY1Ut/hMdZNkw0tzNZOdUPiO4jYIyirReAUiMCm6jXzkTRITj7/vxxWtPAAUR\\ntDNSdXNzZWxsIEUuIFdoaXRha2VyIDx3aGl0YWtlckBldGVybml0eS5kZW1vbi5j\\nby51az4=\\n=LOCL\\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it from here.\\n\\nOver.\\nOno-Sendai Corporation\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughesNsoda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Mon, 21 Sep 92 22:47:51 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: No Subject\\nMessage-ID: <9209220543.AA25094@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nWelcome to the cypherpunks mailing list.\\n\\nWe have a real mailing list now, and not just a mail alias on my\\naccount.

Used with permission>\\n\\n\\nThe basic remailer illustrates how to hook in automated software\\nprocessing into the Unix mail system.  Here are the basic elements.\\n\\n1. .forward\\n2. slocal and .maildelivery\\n3. remail.perl\\n4. /usr/lib/sendmail\\n\\n--------------------------------------------\\n1. .forward\\n\\nUnix mail provides a way to have accounts on many different machines\\nbut to receive all your mail in one place.  That facility is the\\n.forward file, which resides in the home directory.  The file is one\\nline long and contains the email address to which the mail will be\\nforwarded.\\n\\nBut the .forward file has another mode of operation.  If the string\\nbegins with the pipe character \\'|\\', the mail will be piped through the\\nprogram listed.  Enclose the string with double quotes if you need\\nspaces included.  Here is my .forward file:\\n\\n\"| /usr/local/lib/mh/slocal -user hughes\"\\n\\nThus all my mail gets processed by the slocal program, described next.\\n\\nI don\\'t know where the man page for .forward is.  Perhaps someone\\ncould provide a reference.\\n\\n---------\\n\\n2. slocal and .maildelivery\\n\\nThe software system MH contains a bunch of useful tools for handling\\nmail, only one of which we need.  For details on MH, do \\'man mh\\'.\\n\\nMH has a nice little mail hook processor called slocal.  Its docs can\\nbe found by \\'man mhook\\'.  slocal can conditionally perform operations\\non mail messages and consider them either delivered or not.  It allows\\nmultiple operations on individual mail messages.\\n\\nslocal reads the file .maildelivery when it starts up for\\ninstructions. Here is my .maildelivery file:\\n\\n#\\n# field\\t\\t\\tpattern\\taction/\\tstring \\n#\\t\\t\\t\\tresult\\t(quote included spaces)\\n#\\nRequest-Remailing-To\\t\"\"\\tpipe R\\t\"perl remail.perl\" \\nRequest-Remailing-To\\t\"\"\\tfile R\\tarchive.remailer\\n\\nThe various pieces of the .maildelivery file are fully documented in\\nthe man page.  I\\'ll just explain what mine does.  Each line describes\\none operation to be performed on each incoming mail message.  Fields\\nare separated by whitespace, so if you need to include spaces, use\\nquotes.\\n\\nThe first field, labelled field, is the mail header field to look for.\\nslocal can selectively process on any header line.  If the header line\\ndoes not exist, then the mail does not match this line and no\\noperation is performed.  If the header line does exist, processing\\ncontinues.\\n\\nThe second field, pattern, is a text string to match with the contents\\nof that header line, i.e. with everything after the colon.  In my\\ncase, I put the empty string in, which matches everything.  You need\\nthe pair of quotes to have a placeholder for the field contents.\\n\\nThe next field, action, tells what to do with the message.  \\'pipe\\'\\nsends the message to the standard input of the named program.  \\'file\\'\\nappends the message to an archive or log file.  A useful pipe command\\nfor testing is \"tee foo\", which makes a copy of the message in file\\nfoo, but does not append, so that you get an exact copy of what slocal\\nis going to pass to your pipe.  This allows testing of the pipe\\nprogram without sending yourself mail all the time.\\n\\nThe next field, result, tells what to do with the message after\\nprocessing.  I am currently using R for Regardless to indicate that\\nthis action should always be performed no matter what.  The code R\\nindicates that the mail should be considered not delivered after\\nprocessing; thus slocal writes the mail back into my local spool and I\\nsee it as normal.  Later, after I\\'m sick of looking at all the\\nforwarded mail, I\\'ll change this code to A, meaning if the processing\\nsucceeds, then the mail is considered delivered.  The archive file\\nwill always remain R.\\n\\nThe last field, string, is the parameter to the action.  It is a file\\nname or program.  Use quotes to include spaces.  The name of my mail\\nprocessor is \"perl remail.perl\", which is to run the perl script\\nremail.perl on the mail.\\n\\nThe .maildelivery file is also the place to put encryption hooks to\\nautomatically decrypt the bodies of messages.  More on that in a\\nfuture version.\\n\\n---------\\n\\n3. remail.perl\\n\\nPerl is a wonderful language for doing all sorts of useful work like\\nprocessing mail headers.  Do \\'man perl\\' for details, or get the\\nO\\'Reilly book and really learn how to use it.\\n\\nThe perl script, in summary, strips off the mail headers, saving the\\nSubject: line, rewrites a new header, and appends the body of the\\nprevious message.  Here is the script:\\n\\n--------- cut here ---------\\nwhile (<>) {\\n\\tlast if /^$/ ;\\n\\t$subject = $_ if /^Subject:/ ;\\n\\tif (/^Request-Remailing-To:/) {\\n\\t\\tchop ;\\n\\t\\ts/^.*:// ;\\n\\t\\t$addressee = $_ ;\\n\\t}\\n}\\n\\n#open( OUTPUT, \">foo\" ) || die \"Cannot open \\'foo\\'.\" ;\\nopen( OUTPUT, \"| /usr/lib/sendmail \" . $addressee ) ;\\nselect( OUTPUT ) ;\\n\\nprint \"To:\" . $addressee . \"\\\\n\" ;\\nprint \"From: nobody\\\\n\" ;\\nprint $subject ;\\nprint \"Remailed-By: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\\\n\" ;\\nprint \"\\\\n\" ;\\n\\nwhile (<>) {\\n} continue {\\n\\tprint ;\\n}\\n--------- cut here ---------\\n\\nHere is a summary of the operation.  To really understand this, you\\'ll\\nhave to learn perl.\\n\\nThe while loop processes standard input.  \\'last\\' terminates the loop\\nas soon as a blank line is seen.  A blank line separates the header\\nfrom the body.  The subject line, if seen, sets the subject variable\\nto the whole subject line.  The Request- header line has its final\\nnewline removed, the contents up to the colon substituted into\\nnonexistence, and saves the rest in the addressee variable.\\n\\nNext the pipe to sendmail is opened and its output is selected so that\\nall print commands will go to the pipe.  There is a comment for a\\ndifferent output channel to the file foo which can be commented in for\\ntesting.\\n\\nNext the remailed header is constructed out of print statements.\\n\\nLastly the rest of the standard input is passed through unmodified to\\nthe output channel.  The while loop terminates when there is no more\\ninput.\\n\\n---------\\n\\n4. sendmail\\n\\nsendmail is the backend mailer; it expects complete mail messages and\\ndoes not usually generate any line itself except for the first \"From\"\\n(with no colon) line.  Any header you construct will thus get passed\\nthrough mostly unmodified.  Hence you can put in any \"From:\" line you\\nwant and any other header info, such as my \"Remailed-By:\" line.\\n\\nsendmail expects the name of the addressee on its command line,\\notherwise it puts an \"Apparently-To:\" line in the header.\\n\\nAny mail processor which remails should probably go through sendmail,\\nalthough it would also be possible to talk to an SMTP port directly,\\nwere you so motivated.  MH also has some remailing programs; see \\'man\\nmhook\\'.\\n\\n---------\\n\\nA few words for tinkerers.\\n\\n-- You can always send mail to yourself.  Especially after you\\'ve done\\none kind of mail processing and want to pass the mail through the\\nfilters again.\\n\\n-- When getting started, create an empty .maildelivery file first and\\nthen get your .forward file working.  Test it by sending messages to\\nyourself.  If you\\'re not getting them, they are going into the bit\\nbucket.  All your other mail will as well, in this case, so if you\\ncan\\'t afford to lose mail, do it right the first time or work on a\\nspare account.  \\n\\n-- Any mail slocal does not process will get delivered as normal.\\nRunning a remailer will not interfere with your other work.\\n\\n-- Remember to use quote marks.\\n\\n-- You don\\'t need to be a sysadmin to run this kind of remailer.\\nThere is nothing, however, to prevent a sysadmin from running this\\nsofware under an alias.  The sysadmin is also a \\'trusted user\\' to\\nsendmail and can get rid of pesky \"From\"-no-colon lines.\\n\\n-- Perl has a random function which could be used to automatically\\nchoose various \"From:\" lines from a database.  Remember to include\\nyeltsy@kremvax.rus.\\n\\n-- postnews or inews could be substituted for sendmail.  Different\\nheader lines would have to be created.  Such a service could run in\\nparallel with a remailer.  You too can now repost to alt.sex.bondage!\\n\\n\\nEnjoy.  And watch for interesting improvements like encryption.\\n\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Thu, 24 Sep 92 11:13:21 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: The aural Tim Pozar\\nIn-Reply-To: <m0mXwxx-00029lC@kumr.lns.com>\\nMessage-ID: <9209241811.AA23823@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nTim Pozar writes:\\n\\n>I am also the technical consultant to the show, so your mail will not be\\n>falling on deft ears...\\n\\nJust for the record, Tim\\'s _are_ deft, but they are _not_ deaf.\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: pozar@kumr.lns.com (Tim Pozar)\\nDate: Thu, 24 Sep 92 16:42:21 PDT\\nTo: hughes@soda.berkeley.edu (Eric Hughes)\\nSubject: Re: The aural Tim Pozar\\nIn-Reply-To: <9209241811.AA23823@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMessage-ID: <m0mY2oA-00029tC@kumr.lns.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nEric Hughes wrote:\\n> Tim Pozar writes:\\n> \\n> >I am also the technical consultant to the show, so your mail will not be\\n> >falling on deft ears...\\n> \\n> Just for the record, Tim\\'s _are_ deft, but they are _not_ deaf.\\n\\n   Thanks... :-)\\n\\n                     Tim\\n\\n-- \\nInternet: pozar@kumr.lns.com               FidoNet:  Tim Pozar @ 1:125/555\\nUUCP:     ...!uunet!kumr.lns.com!pozar\\nSnail:    Tim Pozar / KKSF / 77 Maiden Lane / San Francisco CA 94108 / USA\\nVoice:    +1 415 788 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: nobody@soda.berkeley.edu\\nDate: Thu, 24 Sep 92 19:32:44 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: through mr. crypto\\nMessage-ID: <9209250231.AA10851@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n** I am also the technical consultant to the show, so your mail will not be\\n** falling on deft ears...\\n\\nAwwww.... it wasn\\'t that badly engineered.\\n\\nsho3t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Mailer-Daemon@atdt.org (Mail Delivery Subsystem)\\nDate: Thu, 24 Sep 92 16:49:37 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Returned mail: Unable to deliver mail\\nMessage-ID: <9209242349.AB06629@atdt.org>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n   ----- Transcript of session follows -----\\n554 cypherpunks@toad.com...

A further 101 had\\nengaged in\\nconduct which allowed, encouraged or caused the occurrence of corrupt\\nconduct.\\n\\n\\nMany are NSW and Commonwealth public servants who sold information\\ncollected by the agencies where they work, including the Roads and\\nTraffic\\nAuthority (RTA), police force, Telecom and Sydney County Council.\\n\\n\\nThe Attorney-General, Mr Hannaford, announced that the Director of\\nPublic\\nProsecutions had set up a task force to consider laying charges\\nagainst\\nmore than 100 people named in the report.\\n\\nHHe said many of the public servants named could expect to lose their\\njobs\\nand that the heads of all the government departments involved had been\\ntold\\nto examine the report and take action against those involved.\\n\\n\\nThe Assistant Police Commissioner, Mr Col Cole, confirmed yesterday\\nthat\\nfive police officers had been suspended and announced that three task\\nforces had been set up and computer security upgraded.\\n\\n\\nMr Hannaford foreshadowed the introduction of privacy legislation to\\nmake\\nthe unauthorised use of confidential information a criminal offence.\\n\\n\\nThe major banks said that they could not condone what their staff had\\ndone\\nbut said the staff had believed that they were acting in the best\\ninterests\\nof their employers and the community.\\n\\n\\nNone of the banks was planning to sack staff found to be corrupt\\nalthough\\nseveral said the staff had been counselled or \"educated\".\\n\\nMMr Roden said the trade involved banks, insurance companies and other\\nfinancial institutions which had provided \"a ready market\".\\n\\n\\nThe link was provided by private and commercial inquiry agents. With\\nsome\\nbanks, codes had been used to conceal the nature of the transactions.\\n\\n\\n\"As they have gone about their corrupt trade, commercial interest has\\nprevailed over commercial ethics, greed ha~ prevailed over public\\nduty;\\nlaws and regulations designed to protect confidentiality have been\\nignored,\" Mr Roden said.\\n\\n\\n\"Frequently the client, generally an insurance company, bank or other\\nfinancial institution, ordered the information from the agent with a\\nfull\\nappreciation of how it was to be obtained.\\n\\n\"\"The evidence disclosed that in the collection and recovery\\ndepartments of\\na number of those institutions, it has long been standard practice to\\nuse\\nconfidential government information . . . as a means of locating\\ndebtors.\"\\n\\n\\nSome finance and insurance companies had directed agents to keep all\\nreferences to the trade off invoices and reports.\\n\\n\\n\"Some even directed that the agents falsely state the source of the\\ninformation in their reports,\" Mr Roden said.\\n\\n\\n\"Some solicitors in private practice have sought and purchased\\nconfidential\\ngovernment information in circumstances in which they must have known\\nthat\\nit could not have been properly obtained.\"\\n\\n\\nMr Kevin Rindfleish, an unlicensed private inquiry agent, had sold\\nDepartment of Motor Transport/Roads and Traffic Authority and social\\nsecurity information \"on a large scale\". His principal client had been\\nthe\\nANZ Bank.\\nAA private investigator, Mr Terence John Hancock, and his company, All\\nCities Investigations Pty Ltd, had sold confidential government\\ninformation\\nto the National Australia Bank and Westpac on a regular basis.\\n\\n\\n Two employees of the NAB had used prior contacts to provide the bank\\nwith\\naccess to RTA, social security, Australia Post and immigration\\ninformation.\\nBetween them, the employees also provided silent numbers and\\ninformation on\\nelectricity consumers.\\n\\n\\nThe Advance Bank had \"over a period of years\" obtained information\\nimproperly released from the RTA, the Department of Social Security\\nand the\\nDepartment of Immigration. The practice was \"known and approved at\\nleast to\\nsenior management level\".\\n\\n\\nNew Zealand Insurance and Manufacturers Mutual had bought confidential\\ngovernment information from private investigators.\\n\\n\\nNRMA Insurance Ltd and the Government Insurance Office were \"found to\\nhave\\nparticipated as freely in the illicit trade in confidential government\\ninformation as their more commercially orientated competitors\".\\n\\n\\n\"Evidence relating to NRMA Insurance Ltd established not only that it\\npurchased confidential government information through private\\ninvestigators, but also that investigators were required to obtain\\nrelevant\\ngovernment information by unauthorised means if they were to retain\\nthe\\ncompany\\'s work.\"\\nEEsanda Finance Corporation Ltd had bought confidential information\\nover at\\nleast 23 years. Custom Credit Corporation Ltd which had engaged in the\\nillicit trade over \"many years\", had maintained false records to\\nconceal\\nhow it obtained information.\\n\\n\\nAlston de Zilwa, former underwriter and operations manager of Citicorp\\nLtd\\nand later, Toyota Finance Australia Limited\\'s credit operations\\nmanager,\\nhad established for each of the two companies a system for obtaining\\nconfidential information.\\n\\n\\nThe companies would seek information directly from employees of the\\nDMA and\\nRTA and pay a private inquiry agent, Mr Kevin Robinson, who would\\n\"launder\"\\nit, then invoice the companies for the corresponding sum.\\n\\n\\nMr Roden said that hundreds of thousands of dollars had changed hands\\nin\\nthe trade uncovered. One agent had estimated that he had paid $40,000\\nto\\n$50,000 a year for Social Security information alone.\\n\\n\\nAnother had said he received $100,000 over two years for government\\ninformation.\\nYYet another had, according to records, charged a bank $186,000 for\\n\"inquiry\\nservices\" over a period of 18 months.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Judith Milhon <stjude@well.sf.ca.us>\\nDate: Fri, 25 Sep 92 03:02:38 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: secretions\\nMessage-ID: <199209251001.AA16909@well.sf.ca.us>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"The alternative to mutual trust, which is indeed a risky gamble, is the\\nsecurity of the police state.\"\\n                -- Alan Watts\\n   \\nThis text may be published in MONDO2000 as my regular column, Irresponsible\\nJournalism.

Thursday\\'s the night, now that the weekend\\nhas annexed Fri. and Mon.  I was lurking in the back, hoping not to see\\nanybody, when the Jones brothers staked me out.  Damn.  They are deep into\\nthe street drugs.  Keeping up with the Joneses is nigh impossible; their\\nmost trivial chitchat is an exercise in decryption.  Eddy -- or maybe he\\nwas being Ellis that night -- was implying something about somebody when my\\nright foot detonated down to its steel toe.

I screamed: \"You\\nstomped my foot FLAT!\"\\n   \"Sorry.\"  \"Are you okay?\"  \"Oh maaaang.\"  Many overlapping voices, all\\nof them synthesized, blurted from above.  Out of two tiny speakers hanging\\nlike earrings off a basketweave headband like a cop\\'s belt.  The head\\nbowed, bringing it almost within biting range.\\n   \"Gah.  Ow.

We\\'re just trying to get some of\\nit back.\"  And the accent was -- Dutch?\\n   Bob\\'s yr uncle.  Gotcha.  I hadn\\'t been certain.

People are ringing in\\nand out.\"\\n   \"You\\'re on line?\"\\n   \"This is a bridge.  International.\"  Sawtooth again.\\n   The cello resumed, an annoyed cello:  \"We don\\'t believe in takeovers.\\nIn fact, we are working to make things UNTAKEOVERABLE.\"\\n   A theremin quivered, \"And to make the world safe for anarchy.  _We want\\nthe air-waves, baby_.\"  It snickered across many frequencies.\\n   The Tejana saxophone chuckled, (and an eerie treat that was, too):\\n\"Problem is, how to guarantee privacy for pseudonyms.  So you can have a\\npseudonymous economy.\"\\n   A toad croaked: \"So, full-RSA encrypted EVERYTHING.  No back doors.\\nSecure digital money.  Swiss bank accounts for the millions.\"\\n   The theremin: \"A global monetary system that makes governments obsolete.\\nDown come the governments.  Goodbye the feds.\"  It sang, whoopingly: \"BYE\\nBYE, LAWWww.\"  Horrible broad-band snickering.\\n   The toad croaked: \"Er... yes.  Real freedom of speech, too.\\nLibertech!\"\\n   The Dutch cello was all business: \"Okay, what does it take?  You need\\nreal-time protocols to prove you own your pseudonym.  And your pseudonyms\\nhave online reputations, via people you\\'ve done biz with -- like a\\ndistributed credit rating system.

As Dylan said: \\'They asked me for some\\ncollateral/ and I pulled down my pants\\'.\"\\n   Orchestral chuckles rained down on me.  Was I an international hit?\\n   But at that exact moment The Memes hit the stage.  The crowd did a 9.1\\nRichter lurch and the other Chador pitched onto my LEFT toe, maybe denting\\nthe steel.\\n   \"AAIEEeeee.  That\\'s great COVERT GEAR you got there, guys.  You couldn\\'t\\nsneak up on Helen Keller in a HAILSTORM.\"  I was trying to spin down.  \"And\\ndudes -- this is not the neighborhood for flashing the hardware.

I wrote it this morning.\\n\\nThe change to make a hopping remailer is very easy.  Here\\'s the new\\nperl script:\\n\\n--------- cut here ---------\\nwhile (<>) {\\n\\tlast if /^$/ ;\\n\\t$subject = $_ if /^Subject:/ ;\\n\\tif (/^Request-Remailing-To:/) {\\n\\t\\tchop ;\\n\\t\\ts/^.*:// ;\\n\\t\\t$addressee = $_ ;\\n\\t}\\n}\\n\\n#open( OUTPUT, \">foo\" ) || die \"Cannot open \\'foo\\'.\" ;\\nopen( OUTPUT, \"| /usr/lib/sendmail \" . $addressee ) ;\\nselect( OUTPUT ) ;\\n\\nprint \"To:\" . $addressee . \"\\\\n\" ;\\nprint \"From: nobody\\\\n\" ;\\nprint $subject ;\\nprint \"Remailed-By: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\\\n\" ;\\n\\n#\\n# check to see if there are header lines in the body to collapse \\n#   into the full header.\\n#\\n\\nif ( $_ = <> ) {\\n\\tif (/^##$/) {\\n\\t\\t# do nothing if the pasting token appears\\n\\t\\t# the rest of the body will be directly appended\\n\\t\\t# this allows for extra header lines to be added\\n\\t} else {\\n\\t\\t# normal line\\n\\t\\tprint \"\\\\n\" ;\\n\\t\\tprint $_ ;\\n\\t}\\n} else {\\n\\t# empty body\\n\\texit ;\\n}\\n\\nwhile (<>) {\\n} continue {\\n\\tprint ;\\n}\\n--------- cut here ---------\\n\\nShort explanation.  The \\'print \"\\\\n\" ;\\' line was moved inside the new\\nif statement.  The if statement reads a line of the body and stops the\\nscript if there is no body.  The line read is tested to see if it\\ncontains the two characters \"##\" alone on the line.  \"##\" is the ANSI\\nC token pasting operator.  If there is no pasting, a blank line is\\nprinted to mark the end of the header and the first line of the body\\nis printed.  If there is pasting, then the conditional does nothing,\\nwhich has the effect that the body is appended directly onto the end\\nof the header, allowing you to add more header lines after the header\\nis rewritten.\\n\\n\\nHere is a sample message that I sent myself after the new script was\\ninstalled:\\n\\n--------- cut here ---------\\nTo: hughes\\nSubject: multiple hops\\nRequest-Remailing-To: hughes\\n\\n##\\nX-Hop: 1\\nRequest-Remailing-To: hughes\\n\\n##\\nX-Hop: 2\\nRequest-Remailing-To: hughes\\n\\n##\\nX-Hop: 3\\n\\nThis is a test message of multiple hops.\\n\\nEric\\n--------- cut here ---------\\n\\n\\nI received four pieces of mail after sending this to myself.  The\\nfirst was the actual letter, which is still delivering normally and\\nnot being filtered.  The next two were the first and second\\nremailings; they had X-Hop: 1 and 2.  The last message was the final\\none, had X-Hop: 3 in its header and was delivered normally.\\n\\nAt each stage, the header got rewritten and a new\\nRequest-Remailing-To: line inserted.  When that mail got delivered, it\\nwas again rewritten, with a new remailing request.  This process is\\nextensible up to the 50K or so practical limitatation on mail size.\\n\\nNote that this system is not at all secure by itself.  But if each\\nmessage body were encrypted first, and the message first decrypted\\nbefore the header re-write took place, the routing instructions as a\\nwhole would be hidden from prying eyes.\\n\\nThat\\'s the next project.\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Mark Pesce <osendai@well.sf.ca.us>\\nDate: Fri, 25 Sep 92 16:27:24 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Pointing out the obvious....\\nMessage-ID: <199209252326.AA19540@well.sf.ca.us>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nHey, Kidz....\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t mean to point out the obvious, but when you mention a certain\\nscheme for secure transfer (3 initials, you guess), or a certain organization\\ndedicated to keeping it from the public (3 initals, you guess again),\\nTHEY READ IT.\\n\\nOK?

The CPSR annual\\nmeeting is a provactive two-day conference that addresses critical\\nissues facing society as a result of information technology.\\n\\nCPSR filed suit against the FBI in September, after the Bureau failed\\nto make public documents that would justify the need for its new\\nwiretap proposal.  The FBI proposal would redesign the telephone\\nnetwork to make wiretapping easier.  Recognizing the importance of\\ncryptography policy, CPSR catalyzed a national debate earlier this\\nyear, as to whether or not the FBI and National Security Agency\\n(NSA) should be involved in setting the technical standards for the\\ncomputer and communications industry.\\n\\nThe panel discussion will include a screening and discussion of film\\nclips from the movie, Sneakers.  Panelists include, Joan Feigenbaum,\\nTechnical Staff, Computing Principles Research, ATT Bell Labs, John\\nGilmore, founder of Cygnus Support, and Dave Banisar, CPSR Policy\\nAnalyst.\\n\\nCPSR\\'s annual meeting will  bring together computer scientists from\\nacross the country to examine the relationship between politics and\\ntechnology.  Other topics include:\\n\\n    *  Teledemocracy & Citizen Participation:\\n        Beyond the Electronic Town Meeting,\\n\\nThis session is an election year look at the dangers and the\\nopportunites of electronic democracy.

This server compares the encrypted string\\n   in the /etc/passwd with a 3Mb dictionary, the gecos-field and username.\\n   The dictionary consists of +- 50.000 english words, +-50.000 dutch\\n   words, sf-authors, girlnames and some other stuff that people tend to\\n   use as passwords.\\n\\n   The dictionary check is done by the very fast HADES hacking engine.\\n   I was surprised by the speed of hades ! The gecos and username\\n   scanning is done by the adapted berkeley hacker , this one also appends\\n   0-9 to the end of the guess, and checks upper/lower case and words\\n   without vowels.\\n\\n\\nHow it works:\\n\\n   You need access to some form of uucp/internet mail facilities to use\\n   the server. Fidonet-users can use the fido <-> internet gateway,\\n   a helpfile for this gateway can be found somewhere on utopia, and on\\n   many other systems in cyberspace.\\n\\n\\n   send your /etc/passwd to: cracker@utopia.hacktic.nl\\n\\n\\n   The cracker will automagically try to guess the passwords in the\\n   passwd file, and send you back any results it found to the E-mail\\n   adress the file came from.\\n\\n\\nIllegal ?\\n\\n   Ofcourse you yourselfe are entirely responsible for your actions, I\\n   really don\\'t care what you do with any passwords from any hacked\\n   account. I trust you to only use this server for \\'educational\\n   purposes\\' :) Read the boiler-plate on Utopia to have deeper insight\\n   in any legal-issues. Furthermore you should read the disclaimer that\\n   comes with the HADES password hacker.\\n\\n\\nThanks:\\n\\n   Thanks go to Zakbar & Remote for making the HADES hacker, to ITSME\\n   for the msdos-berkeley hacker, to Rop for the original idea and to\\n   the cockroaches in my house for entertaining me in those early\\n   hours.\\n\\n======================================================================\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Judith Milhon <stjude@well.sf.ca.us>\\nDate: Sat, 3 Oct 92 18:45:12 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: public vs. private\\nMessage-ID: <199210040152.AA17760@well.sf.ca.us>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmarc suggests:\\n>>I *am* a little worried about publicizing the whole thing;\\n>>perhaps it\\'s okay to make it a showpiece but\\n>>the real stuff needs to be done in a much more private way.\\n\\nConsider the phage model (which I & my roommate efrem lipkin have\\nbeen considering for a longish while, since Community Memory) :\\n\\nThe bacteriophage virus replicates itself by injecting its own\\ninformation into an existing system.

The purpose of the Echo is to provide a place to post and find public-keys for data encryption within FidoNet and elsewhere and to discuss data and software encryption and the various schemes thereof.\\n\\n This is a technical Echo with very few rules. Those very few rules are:\\n\\n1. Stay on-topic. Topics of keys and encryption are welcome. Others are not.\\n\\n 2. No politics [except as it relates to privacy issues] and no religion.\\n\\n 3. No personal attacks, slurs or innuendo. Stick to issues not\\n\\n  personalities.\\n\\n 4. No Private flagged messages in Echomail! Encrypted traffic using\\n\\n  public-keys is permitted for the exercise so long as it is on-topic.\\n\\n 5. This Echo may be traveling around the world so try to be concise. Avoid\\n\\n  excessive quoting for one-liner responses.\\n\\n 6. Be aware that Echomail is NOT secure. Don\\'t take anything at face value.\\n\\n 7. The posts in this Echo are the sole responsiblity of the poster. If you\\n\\n  need verification, use Netmail.\\n\\n 8. The Moderators will deal with off-topic traffic. Don\\'t respond for them.\\n\\n  Links to this Echo will only be curtailed when absolutely necessary so\\n\\n  please don\\'t make it necessary. [grin]\\n\\nThe Moderators are Christopher Baker [KeyID: 1024/4B9A59 1992/10/03] and GK Pace [KeyID: 1024/B6B823 1992/09/28] at 1:374/14 and 1:374/26, respectively.\\n\\n It is recommended that public-keys be made available via Netmail or by file-request with the magic filename: PGPKEY and that the public-key provided for that request by given a distinctive filename using part or all of each provider\\'s name and address. For example, on my system, a file-request of PGPKEY will give BAK37414.ASC to the requesting system. This will avoid duplicate overwriting and make it easier to track the keys. Using a standard magic filename will make it easier to find keys on different systems.\\n\\n This Echo is not currently on the Zone 1 Backbone distribution list but that is expected to change as soon as the word gets out. This Echo will be EListed in ELIST211 next month. Please feel free to announce and distribute this Echo to all interested participants in your area.\\n\\n Thanks.\\n\\n TTFN.  Christopher Baker & GK Pace Moderators\\n\\n-30-\\n\\nany questions? anyone with Areafix already set for this system or for 1:374/26 may link in remotely. all others need to send a Netmail request. the Echo will be distributed privately until it is large enough for moving to the Zone 1 Backbone [or any other Backbones who want to get into it].\\n\\n thanks.\\n\\n TTFN.

Cypherpunks acknowledge that those who want privacy must\\ncreate it for themselves and not expect governments, corporations, or\\nother large, faceless organizations to grant them privacy out of\\nbeneficence.  Cypherpunks know that people have been creating their\\nown privacy for centuries with whispers, envelopes, closed doors, and\\ncouriers.  Cypherpunks do not seek to prevent other people from\\nspeaking about their experiences or their opinions.\\n\\nThe most important means to the defense of privacy is encryption. To\\nencrypt is to indicate the desire for privacy.  But to encrypt with\\nweak cryptography is to indicate not too much desire for privacy.\\nCypherpunks hope that all people desiring privacy will learn how best\\nto defend it.\\n\\nCypherpunks are therefore devoted to cryptography.  Cypherpunks wish\\nto learn about it, to teach it, to implement it, and to make more of\\nit.  Cypherpunks know that cryptographic protocols make social\\nstructures.  Cypherpunks know how to attack a system and how to\\ndefend it.  Cypherpunks know just how hard it is to make good\\ncryptosystems.\\n\\nCypherpunks love to practice.  They love to play with public key\\ncryptography.  They love to play with anonymous and pseudonymous mail\\nforwarding and delivery.  They love to play with DC-nets.  They love\\nto play with secure communications of all kinds.\\n\\nCypherpunks write code.  They know that someone has to write code to\\ndefend privacy, and since it\\'s their privacy, their going to write\\nit.  Cypherpunks publish their code so that their fellow cypherpunks\\nmay practice and play with it.  Cypherpunks realize that security is\\nnot built in a day and are patient with incremental progress.\\n\\nCypherpunks don\\'t care if you don\\'t like the software they write. \\nCypherpunks know that software can\\'t be destroyed.  Cypherpunks know\\nthat a widely dispersed system can\\'t be shut down.\\n\\nCypherpunks will make the networks safe for privacy.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Mon, 5 Oct 92 01:23:23 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Meeting Sat.

Directions are at the end of the message.\\n\\nAttendance is transitive trust, arbitrarily deep.  Invite whoever you\\nwant, and let them do so also, and so on.  Invite them also to join\\nthe mailing list.  Do not, however, just post the announcement.  Time\\nfor that will come.\\n\\nI\\'d like everyone who plans on attending the meeting to send me,\\nhughes@soda.berkeley.edu, a message telling me so.  I\\'d like to get a\\nrough head count before Saturday for game planning.\\n\\nWe are starting at noon because of popular demand.  Eat beforehand or\\nbring a burrito or something.  It will be fine to eat during the first\\nsegment; it won\\'t be any more disruptive than the game is.\\n\\nBring your PGP public key for in-person key distribution, preferably\\non diskette.  We\\'ll need a portable PC or three to do key\\ndistribution; if you have one you can bring, post to the list and tell\\npeople.\\n\\nWe realized after the first meeting that a strict schedule was\\nnonsense.  This meeting has a very informal schedule.\\n\\n\\nSchedule\\n--------\\n\\nStarting at noon, we\\'re going to play session two of the\\ncrypto-anarchy game, in which players try to conduct business under\\nthe watchful eyes of others.  We want to play for two hours and then\\nhave discuss experiences afterward for about an hour.  Some of the\\nimprovements over last time will be flatter denominations of money,\\nwider distribution of commodities, more watchers (governmental and\\notherwise), and perhaps some pre-printed forms.\\n\\nWe\\'ll take a break to regroup for about ten or twenty minutes.\\n\\nFor the second half we\\'ll talk about the security of remailers.  I\\'ll\\nlead the discussion.  We\\'ll be designing protocols and analyzing\\nattacks and defenses.  I\\'ve done this with DigiCash for electronic\\nmoney protocols, and remailers are much easier, but still probably\\nmore than an afternoon\\'s discussion.  We\\'ll do this until six or so,\\nwhen people will have to start leaving.\\n\\nEveryone who wants to will go out for dinner.  I don\\'t know the\\nrestaurants down there; perhaps someone could suggest one?\\n\\n\\nDirections\\n----------\\nIt\\'s at 1937 Landings Drive, Mt.

Their booklet SEIZING THE MEDIA proposes an \\n       all-out artistic assault on coercive communication, cultural \\n       monologue, and media control.

We tend to think of Orwell\\'s 1984, or Terry Gilliam\\'s\\nBrazil,  or  the  proximity  detectors keeping East Berlin\\'s\\nslave/citizens on their own side of the border, or  the  so-\\nphisticated  bugging  devices  Nixon used to harass those on\\nhis \"enemies list.\"  Or, we recognize that for the price  of\\na  ticket  on  the Concorde we can fly at twice the speed of\\nsound, but only if we first walk thru a magnetometer run  by\\na  government  policeman, and permit him to paw thru our be-\\nlongings if it beeps.\\n \\n     But I think that mind-set is a mistake.   Before  there\\nwere cattle prods, governments tortured their prisoners with\\nclubs  and  rubber  hoses.    Before  there  were lasers for\\neavesdropping, governments used binoculars and  lip-readers.\\nThough  government certainly uses technology to oppress, the\\nevil lies not in the tools but in the wielder of the tools.\\n \\n     In fact, technology represents one of the most  promis-\\ning  avenues  available  for  re-capturing our freedoms from\\nthose who have stolen them.  By its very nature,  it  favors\\nthe  bright  (who can put it to use) over the dull (who can-\\nnot).  It favors the adaptable (who are  quick  to  see  the\\nmerit  of  the  new(  over  the sluggish (who cling to time-\\ntested ways).  And what two better words are  there  to  de-\\nscribe government bureaucracy than \"dull\" and \"sluggish\"?\\n \\n     One  of  the  clearest,  classic triumphs of technology\\nover tyranny I see is  the  invention  of  the  man-portable\\ncrossbow.   With it, an untrained peasant could now reliably\\nand lethally engage a target out to  fifty  meters--even  if\\nthat  target  were  a mounted, chain-mailed knight.  (Unlike\\nthe longbow, which, admittedly was more powerful, and  could\\nget  off  more shots per unit time, the crossbow required no\\nformal training to utilize.   Whereas the  longbow  required\\nelaborate  visual,  tactile  and kinesthetic coordination to\\nachieve any degree of accuracy, the wielder  of  a  crossbow\\ncould simply put the weapon to his shoulder, sight along the\\narrow  itself, and be reasonably assured of hitting his tar-\\nget.)\\n \\n     Moreover, since just about  the  only  mounted  knights\\nlikely  to  visit  your  average peasant would be government\\nsoldiers and tax collectors, the utility of the  device  was\\nplain:    With it, the common rabble could defend themselves\\nnot only against one another, but against their governmental\\nmasters.   It was the  medieval  equivalent  of  the  armor-\\npiercing  bullet,  and, consequently, kings and priests (the\\nmedieval equivalent of a  Bureau  of  Alcohol,  Tobacco  and\\nCrossbows)  threatened  death  and  excommunication, respec-\\ntively, for its unlawful possession.\\n \\n     Looking at later developments, we  see  how  technology\\nlike  the  firearm--particularly the repeating rifle and the\\nhandgun, later followed by the Gatling gun and more advanced\\nmachine guns--radically altered the balance of interpersonal\\nand inter-group power.  Not without reason was the Colt  .45\\ncalled \"the equalizer.\"  A frail dance-hall hostess with one\\nin  her  possession  was  now  fully able to protect herself\\nagainst the brawniest roughneck in any saloon.    Advertise-\\nments  for  the period also reflect the merchandising of the\\nrepeating cartridge  rifle  by  declaring  that  \"a  man  on\\nhorseback,  armed with one of these rifles, simply cannot be\\ncaptured.\"  And, as long as his captors  were  relying  upon\\nflintlocks  or  single-shot rifles, the quote is doubtless a\\ntrue one.\\n \\n     Updating now to  the  present,  the  public-key  cipher\\n(with  a  personal  computer to run it) represents an equiv-\\nalent quantum leap--in a defensive weapon.    Not  only  can\\nsuch  a technique be used to protect sensitive data in one\\'s\\nown possession, but it can also permit two strangers to  ex-\\nchange   information   over   an   insecure   communications\\nchannel--a  wiretapped   phone   line,   for   example,   or\\nskywriting, for that matter)--without ever having previously\\nmet  to  exchange cipher keys.   With a thousand-dollar com-\\nputer, you can create a cipher that  a  multi-megabuck  CRAY\\nX-MP  can\\'t  crack in a year.  Within a few years, it should\\nbe economically feasible to similarly encrypt voice communi-\\ncations; soon after that, full-color digitized video images.\\nTechnology will not only have made wiretapping obsolete,  it\\nwill  have  totally demolished government\\'s control over in-\\nformation transfer.\\n \\n     I\\'d like to take just a moment to sketch the  mathemat-\\nics  which makes this principle possible.  This algorithm is\\ncalled the RSA algorithm, after Rivest, Shamir, and  Adleman\\nwho  jointly created it.  Its security derives from the fact\\nthat, if a very large number is  the  product  of  two  very\\nlarge  primes,  then it is extremely difficult to obtain the\\ntwo prime factors from analysis  of  their  product.    \"Ex-\\ntremely\"  in  the  sense that if primes  p  and  q  have 100\\ndigits apiece, then their 200-digit product cannot  in  gen-\\neral be factored in less than 100 years by the most powerful\\ncomputer now in existence.\\n \\n     The  \"public\" part of the key consists of (1) the prod-\\nuct  pq  of the two large primes p and q, and (2)  one  fac-\\ntor,  call it  x  , of the product  xy  where  xy = {(p-1) *\\n(q-1) + 1}.  The \"private\" part of the key consists  of  the\\nother factor  y.\\n \\n     Each  block of the text to be encrypted is first turned\\ninto an integer--either by using ASCII,  or  even  a  simple\\nA=01,  B=02,  C=03, ... , Z=26 representation.  This integer\\nis then raised to the power  x (modulo pq) and the resulting\\ninteger is then sent as the encrypted message.  The receiver\\ndecrypts by taking this integer to the  (secret)  power    y\\n(modulo  pq).  It can be shown that this process will always\\nyield the original number started with.\\n \\n     What makes this a groundbreaking development,  and  why\\nit  is  called  \"public-key\"  cryptography,\"  is  that I can\\nopenly publish the product  pq and the number   x   ,  while\\nkeeping  secret  the number  y  --so that anyone can send me\\nan encrypted message, namely\\n                       x\\n                     a    (mod pq)  ,\\nbut only I can recover the original message  a  , by  taking\\nwhat  they  send, raising it to the power  y  and taking the\\nresult (mod pq).  The risky step (meeting to exchange cipher\\nkeys) has been eliminated.  So people who may not even trust\\neach other enough to want to meet, may  still  reliably  ex-\\nchange  encrypted  messages--each  party having selected and\\ndisseminated his own  pq  and his  x  ,   while  maintaining\\nthe secrecy of his own  y.\\n \\n     Another benefit of this scheme is the notion of a \"dig-\\nital signature,\" to enable one to authenticate the source of\\na given message.  Normally, if I want to send you a message,\\nI raise my plaintext  a  to your x and take the result  (mod\\nyour pq)  and send that.\\n \\n    However,  if in my message, I take the plaintext  a and\\nraise it to my (secret) power  y  , take the result  (mod my\\npq), then raise that result to your x   (mod  your  pq)  and\\nsend this, then even after you have normally \"decrypted\" the\\nmessage,  it  will still look like garbage.  However, if you\\nthen raise it to my public power x   , and take  the  result\\n(mod  my public pq  ), so you will not only recover the ori-\\nginal plaintext message, but you will know that no one but I\\ncould have sent it to you (since no one else knows my secret\\ny).\\n \\n     And these are the very concerns by the way that are to-\\nday tormenting the Soviet Union about the whole question  of\\npersonal  computers.    On the one hand, they recognize that\\nAmerican schoolchildren are right now growing up  with  com-\\nputers  as commonplace as sliderules used to be--more so, in\\nfact, because there are things computers can do  which  will\\ninterest  (and instruct) 3- and 4-year-olds.  And it is pre-\\ncisely these students who one generation hence will be going\\nhead-to-head against their Soviet  counterparts.    For  the\\nSoviets  to  hold  back might be a suicidal as continuing to\\nteach swordsmanship  while  your  adversaries  are  learning\\nballistics.    On  the  other hand, whatever else a personal\\ncomputer may be, it is also an exquisitely efficient copying\\nmachine--a floppy disk will hold upwards of 50,000 words  of\\ntext,  and  can  be  copied in a couple of minutes.  If this\\nweren\\'t threatening enough, the computer that  performs  the\\ncopy  can also encrypt the data in a fashion that is all but\\nunbreakable.  Remember that in Soviet society  publicly  ac-\\ncessible  Xerox  machines are unknown.   (The relatively few\\ncopying machines in existence  are  controlled  more  inten-\\nsively than machine guns are in the United States.)\\n \\n     Now  the  \"conservative\" position is that we should not\\nsell these computers to the Soviets, because they could  use\\nthem  in weapons systems.  The \"liberal\" position is that we\\nshould sell them, in  the  interests  of  mutual  trade  and\\ncooperation--and  anyway,  if  we don\\'t make the sale, there\\nwill certainly be some other nation willing to.\\n \\n     For my part, I\\'m ready to suggest that the  Libertarian\\nposition should be to give them to the Soviets for free, and\\nif  necessary, make them take them . . . and if that doesn\\'t\\nwork load up an SR-71  Blackbird  and  air  drop  them  over\\nMoscow in the middle of the night.  Paid for by private sub-\\nscription, of course, not taxation . . . I confess that this\\nis not a position that has gained much support among members\\nof  the conventional left-right political spectrum, but, af-\\nter all, in the words of one of Illuminatus\\'s characters, we\\nare political non-Euclideans:   The shortest distance  to  a\\nparticular  goal may not look anything like what most people\\nwould consider a \"straight line.\"    Taking  a  long  enough\\nworld-view,  it is arguable that breaking the Soviet govern-\\nment monopoly on information transfer could better  lead  to\\nthe enfeeblement and, indeed, to the ultimate dissolution of\\nthe Soviet empire than would the production of another dozen\\nmissiles aimed at Moscow.\\n \\n     But  there\\'s  the rub:  A \"long enough\" world view does\\nsuggest that the evil, the oppressive, the coercive and  the\\nsimply  stupid  will \"get what they deserve,\" but what\\'s not\\nimmediately clear is how the rest of  us  can  escape  being\\nkilled, enslaved, or pauperized in the process.\\n \\n    When  the  liberals and other collectivists began to at-\\ntack freedom, they possessed a reasonably  stable,  healthy,\\nfunctioning economy, and almost unlimited time to proceed to\\nhamstring   and   dismantle  it.    A  policy  of  political\\ngradualism was at least  conceivable.    But  now,  we  have\\npatchwork  crazy-quilt  economy held together by baling wire\\nand spit.  The state not only taxes us to  \"feed  the  poor\"\\nwhile also inducing farmers to slaughter milk cows and drive\\nup food prices--it then simultaneously turns around and sub-\\nsidizes research into agricultural chemicals designed to in-\\ncrease  yields of milk from the cows left alive.  Or witness\\nthe fact that a decline in the price of oil is considered as\\npotentially frightening as a comparable increase a few years\\nago.  When the price went up,  we  were  told,  the  economy\\nrisked  collapse for for want of energy.  The price increase\\nwas called the \"moral equivalent of war\" and the Feds  swung\\ninto  action.    For the first time in American history, the\\nspeed at which you drive your car to work in the morning be-\\ncame an issue of Federal concern.   Now, when the  price  of\\noil  drops, again we risk problems, this time because Ameri-\\ncan oil companies and Third World  basket-case  nations  who\\nsell  oil  may  not  be  able to ever pay their debts to our\\ngrossly over-extended banks.  The suggested panacea is  that\\ngovernment  should now re-raise the oil prices that OPEC has\\nlowered, via a new oil tax.  Since the government is seeking\\nto raise oil prices to about the same extent  as  OPEC  did,\\nwhat  can we call this except the \"moral equivalent of civil\\nwar--the government against its own people?\"\\n \\n     And, classically, in international trade, can you imag-\\nine any entity in the world except  a  government  going  to\\ncourt  claiming  that  a  vendor  was  selling  it goods too\\ncheaply and demanding not only that that naughty  vendor  be\\ncompelled by the court to raise its prices, but also that it\\nbe punished for the act of lowering them in the first place?\\n \\n     So  while the statists could afford to take a couple of\\nhundred years to trash our  economy  and  our  liberties--we\\ncertainly  cannot  count  on  having an equivalent period of\\nstability in which to reclaim them.   I contend  that  there\\nexists  almost  a  \"black  hole\"  effect in the evolution of\\nnation-states just as in the evolution of stars.  Once free-\\ndom contracts beyond a certain  minimum  extent,  the  state\\nwarps  the fabric of the political continuum about itself to\\nthe degree that subsequent re-emergence of  freedom  becomes\\nall but impossible.  A good illustration of this can be seen\\nin the area of so-called \"welfare\" payments.  When those who\\nsup  at the public trough outnumber (and thus outvote) those\\nwhose taxes must replenish the trough,  then  what  possible\\nchoice has a democracy but to perpetuate and expand the tak-\\ning  from  the few for the unearned benefit of the many?  Go\\ndown to the nearest \"welfare\" office, find just  two  people\\non  the dole . . . and recognize that between them they form\\na voting bloc that can forever outvote you on  the  question\\nof who owns your life--and the fruits of your life\\'s labor.\\n \\n     So essentially those who love liberty need an \"edge\" of\\nsome  sort  if  we\\'re ultimately going to prevail.  We obvi-\\nously  can\\'t  use  the  altruists\\'  \"other-directedness\"  of\\n\"work,  slave, suffer, sacrifice, so that next generation of\\na billion random strangers can  live  in  a  better  world.\"\\nRecognize  that, however immoral such an appeal might be, it\\nis nonetheless an extremely powerful one in today\\'s culture.\\nIf you can convince  people  to  work  energetically  for  a\\n\"cause,\" caring only enough for their personal welfare so as\\nto  remain  alive  enough  and  healthy  enough  to continue\\nworking--then you have a truly massive reservoir  of  energy\\nto draw from.  Equally clearly, this is just the sort of ap-\\npeal which tautologically cannot be utilized for egoistic or\\nlibertarian goals.  If I were to stand up before you tonight\\nand say something like, \"Listen, follow me as I enunciate my\\nnoble \"cause,\" contribute your money to support the \"cause,\"\\ngive  up  your  free  time  to  work for the \"cause,\" strive\\nselflessly to bring it about, and then (after you  and  your\\nchildren are dead) maybe your children\\'s children will actu-\\nally  live under egoism\"--you\\'d all think I\\'d gone mad.  And\\nof course you\\'d be right.  Because the point I\\'m  trying  to\\nmake is that libertarianism and/or egoism will be spread if,\\nwhen, and as, individual libertarians and/or egoists find it\\nprofitable and/or enjoyable to do so.    And  probably  only\\nthen.\\n \\n     While I certainly do not disparage the concept of poli-\\ntical  action, I don\\'t believe that it is the only, nor even\\nnecessarily the most cost-effective path  toward  increasing\\nfreedom  in  our time.  Consider that, for a fraction of the\\ninvestment in time, money and effort I might expend in  try-\\ning  to  convince  the  state to abolish wiretapping and all\\nforms of censorship--I can teach every libertarian who\\'s in-\\nterested  how  to   use   cryptography   to   abolish   them\\nunilaterally.\\n \\n     There  is  a  maxim--a proverb--generally attributed to\\nthe Eskimoes, which very likely most Libertarians  have  al-\\nready  heard.    And while you likely would not quarrel with\\nthe saying, you might well feel that you\\'ve heard  it  often\\nenough already, and that it has nothing further to teach us,\\nand moreover, that maybe you\\'re even tired of hearing it.  I\\nshall therefore repeat it now:\\n \\n     If you give a man a fish, the saying runs, you feed him\\nfor a day.  But if you teach a man how to fish, you feed him\\nfor a lifetime.\\n \\n     Your exposure to the quote was probably in some sort of\\na  \"workfare\"  vs.  \"welfare\"  context;  namely, that if you\\ngenuinely wish to help someone in need, you should teach him\\nhow to earn his sustenance, not simply how to  beg  for  it.\\nAnd of course this is true, if only because the next time he\\nis hungry, there might not be anybody around willing or even\\nable to give him a fish, whereas with the information on how\\nto fish, he is completely self sufficient.\\n \\n     But  I  submit  that this exhausts only the first order\\ncontent of the quote, and if there were nothing  further  to\\nglean  from  it,  I would have wasted your time by citing it\\nagain.  After all, it seems to have almost a crypto-altruist\\nslant, as though to imply that we should structure  our  ac-\\ntivities  so  as  to  maximize  the  benefits to such hungry\\nbeggars as we may encounter.\\n \\n     But consider:\\n \\n     Suppose this Eskimo doesn\\'t know how to  fish,  but  he\\ndoes  know  how  to hunt walruses.   You, on the other hand,\\nhave often gone hungry while traveling thru  walrus  country\\nbecause  you  had  no idea how to catch the damn things, and\\nthey ate most of the fish you could catch.  And now  suppose\\nthe  two  of  you  decide to exchange information, bartering\\nfishing knowledge for hunting knowledge.   Well,  the  first\\nthing  to  observe  is  that  a  transaction  of  this  type\\ncategorically and unambiguously refutes the Marxist  premise\\nthat  every  trade  must  have a \"winner\" and a \"loser;\" the\\nidea that if one person gains, it must necessarily be at the\\n\"expense\" of another person who loses.  Clearly, under  this\\nscenario, such is not the case.  Each party has gained some-\\nthing  he  did  not have before, and neither has been dimin-\\nished in any way.  When it comes to exchange of  information\\n(rather  than material objects) life is no longer a zero-sum\\ngame.  This is an extremely powerful notion.   The  \"law  of\\ndiminishing   returns,\"   the  \"first  and  second  laws  of\\nthermodynamics\"--all those \"laws\" which constrain our possi-\\nbilities in other contexts--no longer bind us!   Now  that\\'s\\nanarchy!\\n \\n     Or  consider  another possibility:  Suppose this hungry\\nEskimo never learned  to  fish  because  the  ruler  of  his\\nnation-state    had  decreed fishing illegal.   Because fish\\ncontain dangerous tiny bones, and sometimes sharp spines, he\\ntells us, the state has decreed that their  consumption--and\\neven  their  possession--are  too  hazardous to the people\\'s\\nhealth to be permitted . . . even by knowledgeable,  willing\\nadults.   Perhaps it is because citizens\\' bodies are thought\\nto be government property, and therefore it is the  function\\nof the state to punish those who improperly care for govern-\\nment  property.    Or perhaps it is because the state gener-\\nously extends to competent adults the \"benefits\" it provides\\nto children and to the mentally ill:  namely,  a  full-time,\\nall-pervasive supervisory conservatorship--so that they need\\nnot  trouble  themselves  with making choices about behavior\\nthought physically risky or morally \"naughty.\"  But, in  any\\ncase,  you  stare stupefied, while your Eskimo informant re-\\nlates how this law is taken so seriously that  a  friend  of\\nhis was recently imprisoned for years for the crime of \"pos-\\nsession of nine ounces of trout with intent to distribute.\"\\n \\n     Now  you  may  conclude  that  a society so grotesquely\\noppressive as to enforce a law of this  type  is  simply  an\\naffront to the dignity of all human beings.  You may go far-\\nther  and  decide to commit some portion of your discretion-\\nary, recreational time specifically to the task of thwarting\\nthis tyrant\\'s goal.  (Your rationale may be \"altruistic\"  in\\nthe   sense   of  wanting  to  liberate  the  oppressed,  or\\n\"egoistic\" in the sense of  proving  you  can  outsmart  the\\noppressor--or  very likely some combination of these or per-\\nhaps even other motives.)\\n \\n     But, since you have zero desire to become a  martyr  to\\nyour \"cause,\" you\\'re not about to mount a military campaign,\\nor  even try to run a boatload of fish through the blockade.\\nHowever, it is here that technology--and in  particular  in-\\nformation technology--can multiply your efficacy literally a\\nhundredfold.    I say \"literally,\" because for a fraction of\\nthe effort (and virtually none of  the  risk)  attendant  to\\nsmuggling in a hundred fish, you can quite readily produce a\\nhundred  Xerox copies of fishing instructions.  (If the tar-\\ngeted government, like present-day America, at least permits\\nopen  discussion  of  topics  whose  implementation  is  re-\\nstricted,  then that should suffice.  But, if the government\\nattempts to suppress the flow of information as  well,  then\\nyou will have to take a little more effort and perhaps write\\nyour  fishing manual on a floppy disk encrypted according to\\nyour mythical Eskimo\\'s public-key parameters.  But as far as\\nincreasing real-world access to fish you have  made  genuine\\nnonzero  headway--which  may  continue to snowball as others\\nre-disseminate the information you have provided.   And  you\\nhave not had to waste any of your time trying to convert id-\\neological  adversaries, or even trying to win over the unde-\\ncided.  Recall Harry Browne\\'s dictum  from  \"Freedom  in  an\\nUnfree World\" that the success of any endeavor is in general\\ninversely proportional to the number of people whose persua-\\nsion is necessary to its fulfilment.\\n \\n     If  you  look  at  history, you cannot deny that it has\\nbeen dramatically shaped by men with names like  Washington,\\nLincoln,  .  .  .  Nixon  .  . . Marcos . . . Duvalier . . .\\nKhadaffi . . .  and their ilk.  But it has also been  shaped\\nby  people with names like Edison, Curie, Marconi, Tesla and\\nWozniak.  And this latter shaping has been at least as  per-\\nvasive, and not nearly so bloody.\\n \\n     And  that\\'s  where  I\\'m  trying  to  take The LiberTech\\nProject.  Rather than beseeching the state to please not en-\\nslave, plunder or constrain us, I propose a libertarian net-\\nwork spreading  the  technologies  by  which  we  may  seize\\nfreedom for ourselves.\\n \\n     But here we must be a bit careful.  While it is not (at\\npresent)  illegal  to  encrypt  information  when government\\nwants to spy on you, there is no guarantee of what  the  fu-\\nture  may hold.  There have been bills introduced, for exam-\\nple, which would have made it a crime  to  wear  body  armor\\nwhen government wants to shoot you.  That is, if you were to\\ncommit certain crimes while wearing a Kevlar vest, then that\\nfact  would  constitute a separate federal crime of its own.\\nThis law to my knowledge has not passed . . . yet . . .  but\\nit does indicate how government thinks.\\n \\n     Other  technological  applications,  however, do indeed\\npose legal risks.  We recognize, for  example,  that  anyone\\nwho  helped a pre-Civil War slave escape on the \"underground\\nrailroad\" was making a clearly illegal use of technology--as\\nthe sovereign government of the United States of America  at\\nthat time found the buying and selling of human beings quite\\nas  acceptable  as  the buying and selling of cattle.  Simi-\\nlarly, during Prohibition, anyone who used  his  bathtub  to\\nferment  yeast and sugar into the illegal psychoactive drug,\\nalcohol--the controlled substance, wine--was using  technol-\\nogy  in a way that could get him shot dead by federal agents\\nfor his \"crime\"--unfortunately not to be  restored  to  life\\nwhen  Congress  reversed itself and re-permitted use of this\\ndrug.\\n \\n     So . . . to quote a former President,  un-indicted  co-\\nconspirator  and pardoned felon . . . \"Let me make one thing\\nperfectly clear:\"  The LiberTech Project does not  advocate,\\nparticipate  in, or conspire in the violation of any law--no\\nmatter how oppressive,  unconstitutional  or  simply  stupid\\nsuch  law may be.  It does engage in description (for educa-\\ntional and informational  purposes  only)  of  technological\\nprocesses,  and some of these processes (like flying a plane\\nor manufacturing a firearm) may well require appropriate li-\\ncensing to perform legally.    Fortunately,  no  license  is\\nneeded  for  the  distribution or receipt of information it-\\nself.\\n \\n     So, the next time you look at the political  scene  and\\ndespair,  thinking,  \"Well,  if 51% of the nation and 51% of\\nthis State, and 51% of this city have  to  turn  Libertarian\\nbefore  I\\'ll  be  free,  then  somebody might as well cut my\\ngoddamn throat now, and put me out of my  misery\"--recognize\\nthat  such  is not the case.

Just finished.  Fidonet support.  Dumb mailer support.  Incoming\\nheader line pasting.\\n\\nHere\\'s what\\'s going on.  There are a lot of mailers, the Fidonet\\ngateway in particular, which don\\'t allow you to put arbitrary header\\nlines in your outgoing messages.  Previously people using these\\nsystems couldn\\'t use the remailer because they couldn\\'t put the\\nnecessary \"Request-Remailing-To:\" in the header.\\n\\nNow they can.  Instead of putting header lines into actual header, I\\nnow support a syntax which allows header lines to be _added_ to the\\nheader on incoming mail.

This restricts them from using the remailer.  I\\nhave added a facility to allow new header fields to be pasted onto the\\nend of a header when the mail arrives.  This effectively happens\\nbefore processing by the remailer software.  These new fields exist\\nduring transit in the message body, where they remain untouched.  Only\\nafter the message is delivered to my account does this operator\\ntake effect.\\n\\nSyntax: If the first line of the body is the two characters \"::\", then\\nthe following lines are appended to the header, up to the next blank\\nline.\\n\\nHere\\'s how it works.\\n\\nFirst of all, here\\'s my new .maildelivery file:\\n\\n------- cut here -------\\n#\\n# field\\t\\t\\tpattern\\taction/\\tstring \\n#\\t\\t\\t\\tresult\\t(quote included spaces)\\n#\\nRequest-Remailing-To\\t\"\"\\tpipe R\\t\"perl remailer/remail.perl\" \\nRequest-Remailing-To\\t\"\"\\tfile R\\tremailer/archive\\n*\\t\\t\\t\"\"\\tpipe R\\t\"/usr/local/lib/mh/rcvtty -biff\"\\n*\\t\\t\\t\"\"\\tpipe ?\\t\"perl remailer/incoming.header.perl\"\\n------- cut here -------\\n\\nComments are indicated by #.  The Request-Remailing-To lines have been\\nthere.  The second of the makes an archive for debugging purposes.  It\\nwill go eventually.  The third field, \"*\", indicates all fields, it\\nruns \\'rcvtty\\' on my mail; this replaces the function of biff, since\\nmail is getting piped to slocal now, disabling biff.\\n\\nThe last line is the important one.  It says \"If the mail hasn\\'t been\\ndelivered by now, run the incoming header rewrite script on it.  If\\nthat doesn\\'t work, continue trying to deliver it.\"\\n\\nNow here\\'s the trick.  slocal has no way of taking the output of the\\nrewrite and continuing to process it.  (It should.  It would make this\\nwhole job easy.)  So in order to continue processing, you need to\\nredeliver the mail.  You could invoke sendmail and mail it back to\\nyourself, but that would mangle the existing header.  So the thing to\\ndo is to recursively invoke slocal from within the perl script.\\n\\nHere\\'s the perl script to do all this:\\n\\n------- cut here -------\\n  # First read in the whole header.\\n  # We check for the Second-Pass: line to detect infinite loops.\\n\\nwhile (<>) {\\n\\tlast if /^$/ ;\\n\\texit 1 if /^Second-Pass:/ ;\\n\\t$header .= $_ ;\\n}\\n\\n  # We have just read the last line in the header.\\n  # Now we check to see if there is a pasting operator.\\n\\nif ( ( $_ = <> ) && /^::$/ ) {\\n\\twhile (<>) {\\n\\t\\tlast if /^$/ ;\\n\\t\\t$header .= $_ ;\\n\\t}\\n} else {\\n\\t# There is either an empty body or no pasting operator\\n\\t#   Thus exit with a return code of 1 to indicate that\\n\\t#   the mail has not been delivered.\\n\\t\\texit 1 ;\\n}\\n\\n# There was a header pasting operator.\\n#   So we open \\'slocal\\' as a pipe, effectively redelivering the mail\\n#   back to ourselves.\\n\\n#open( OUTPUT, \">foo\" ) ;\\nopen( OUTPUT, \"| /usr/local/lib/mh/slocal -user hughes\" ) ;\\nselect( OUTPUT ) ;\\n\\n# print a \"From \" line to satisfy slocal\\n\\n@weekdays = ( \"Sun\",\"Mon\",\"Tue\",\"Wed\",\"Thu\",\"Fri\", \"Sat\" ) ;\\n@months = ( \"Jan\",\"Feb\",\"Mar\",\"Apr\",\"May\",\\n\\t\"Jun\",\"Jul\",\"Aug\",\"Sep\",\"Oct\",\"Nov\",\"Dec\" ) ;\\n($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst) = localtime ;\\nprintf \"From hughes  %s %s \", @weekdays[ $wday ], @months[ $mon ] ;\\nprintf \"%2d %02d:%02d:%02d 19%d\\\\n\", $mday, $hour, $min, $sec, $year ;\\n\\n# Now just print out the message\\n\\nprint $header ;\\nprint \"Second-Pass:\\\\n\" ;\\nprint \"\\\\n\" ; \\nwhile (<>) {\\n} continue {\\n\\tprint ;\\n}\\n\\n------- cut here -------\\n\\nHere\\'s how the perl script works.\\n\\nThe first loop reads lines from the existing header.  When it sees a\\nblank line (regexp /^$/) it terminates the loop.  If it sees a field\\n\"Second-Pass\", it knows it has filtered this message before and exits\\nwith a return code indicating that the mail has not been delivered.\\nThe variable $header is appended with the current header line.\\n$header contains the whole header when the loop terminates.\\n\\nProperly speaking, the Second-Pass test is not necessary to detect\\ninfinite loops.  Since the pasting operator gets removed during the\\nrewrite, the script won\\'t return an exit status of 0 more times than\\nthe pasting operator appears.  But should something get screwed up,\\nsuch as a different module adding pasting commands (how? I don\\'t know),\\nthe Second-Pass test should prevent infinite recursion.\\n\\nThe next statement reads another line from the input file.  This line\\nis the first line of the message body.  If this line is the pasting\\noperator, then header lines are accumulated in $header as before until\\na blank line.  The difference is that these header lines are being\\nread from the body of the message.  If there is no pasting operator,\\nthe script exits undelivered.\\n\\nAt this point we now have to redeliver the message back to ourselves.\\nWe first open slocal as the output pipe.\\n\\nThe next section is a kludge.  It turns out that slocal strips off the\\nout-of-band \"From \" (no colon) line that the mail delivery system\\nuses.  In other words, the message which slocal pipes into its pipes\\nis not identical to the message it itself received.  This means that\\nslocal cannot be directly recursed.  What this section does is to\\ncreate a \"From \" line to make slocal happy.  It calls localtime() and\\nthen formats those numbers into the proper form.\\n\\nIt turns out that slocal will deliver this mail without the \"From \"\\nline, even to /usr/spool/mail, but it doesn\\'t do so properly.  On my\\nsystem, in added some delimiters which I think I\\'ve tracked down to\\nthe \\'mtstailor\\' file, namely mmdelivery1 and mmdelivery2.  Since these\\nare not null on my system, there\\'s some garbage added which screws up\\nseparation of the spool file into messages.  Adding a \"From \" line\\nfixes that.  This misbehavior may not be so surprising, considering\\nthat slocal was \"meant\" to be invoked only in a .forward file.\\n\\nNow we print the variable $header which contains the whole header,\\nincluding newlines.  Using a single string removes the need for an\\narray.  We added the Second-Pass line and a blank line for the end of\\nthe header.  The final loop prints out the rest of the message body.\\n\\nThere is another way to proceed to get the same functionality.  One\\ncould write a filter to translate the first occurrence only of\\n\\\\n\\\\n::\\\\n into \\\\n. We could then pass the message through this filter\\nbefore slocal saw it.  And for now, that would do the same thing.\\n\\nBut suppose we want more that one rewrite rule active?  Then you would\\nonly be able to apply each rewrite rule exactly once in fixed order.\\nYou want to be able to rewrite a message and then apply all the\\nrewrite rules again.  \\n\\nAt least one other rewrite rule is planned: automatic decryption.\\nSince decrypting a message will completely change the body, and since\\nsome of the header fields may need to be hidden, you have to be able\\nto decrypt the body and then paste on header lines.  But since you\\nneed to indicate an encrypted body by a header line (well, not really,\\nbut it\\'s more reliable), and since some people can\\'t add these header\\nlines, you need to paste lines before encryption as well.\\n\\nThus the rewrite rules need to be applied asyncronously and hence I\\'m\\nusing a fairly complex slocal scheme to do a simple filter.\\nEventually I hope to write an equivalent to slocal which knows about\\nmessage rewrites and simple filters, but that\\'s for later.\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Tom.Jennings@f111.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Tom Jennings)\\nDate: Fri, 9 Oct 92 11:13:54 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: re: +-=*^\\nMessage-ID: <2747.2AD5CD4D@fidogate.FIDONET.ORG>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\n U> re: problem with key distribution; right, OK, I hadn\\'t \\n U> thought that there might be a security problem with \\n U> casually giving someone your key without them being able \\n U> to authenticate that it came from you.

The RSA\\n         algorithm is popular in the computer industry, but the\\n         government favors an alternative.\\n\\n======================================================================\\n\\nANYONE can sign a postcard, but how do you sign a piece of electronic\\nmail? Without a \"signature\" to demonstrate that, say, an electronic\\ntransfer of funds really comes from someone authorised to make the\\ntransfer, progress towards all-electronic commerce is stymied. Ways of\\nproducing such signatures are available, thanks to the technology of\\npublic-key cryptography. They will not work to everyone\\'s best\\nadvantage, though, until everyone uses the same public-key system. It\\nis an obvious opportunity for standards-makers - but in America they\\nhave turned up their noses at all the variations on the theme\\ncurrently in use. The alternative standard for digital signatures now\\noffered by America\\'s National Institute of Standards and Technology \\n(NIST) has brought a long-simmering controversy back to the boil.\\n\\nPublic-key cryptography could become one of the most common\\ntechnologies of the information age, underpinning all sorts of routine\\ntransactions. Not only does it promise to provide the digital\\nequivalent of a signature, it could also give users an electronic\\nenvelope to keep private messages from prying eyes. The idea is to\\ncreate codes that have two related keys. In conventional cryptography\\nthe sender and receiver share a single secret key; the sender uses it\\nto encode the message, the receiver to decode it. In public-key\\ntechniques, each person has a pair of keys: a disclosed public key and\\na secret private key. Messages encoded with the private key can only\\nbe decoded with the corresponding public key, and vice versa. The\\npublic keys are published like telephone numbers. The private keys are\\nsecret.\\n\\nWith this technology, digital signatures are simple. Encode your\\nmessage, or just the name you sign it with, using your private key. If\\nthe recipient can decode the message with your public key, he can be\\nconfident it came from you. Sending a confidential message - putting\\nelectronic mail in a tamper-proof envelope - is equally\\nstraightforward. To send a secret to Alice encode it with her public\\nkey. Only Alice (or someone else who knows her private key) will be\\nable to decode the message.\\n\\nThe heart of any system of public-key cryptography is a mathematical\\nfunction which takes in a message and a key, and puts out a code. This\\nfunction must be fairly quick and easy to use, so that putting things\\ninto code does not take forever. It must be very hard to undo, so that\\ngetting things out of code does take forever, unless the decoder has\\nthe decoding key. Obviously, there must be no easy way to deduce the\\nprivate key from the public key.\\n\\nFinding functions that meet these criteria is \"a combination of\\nmathematics and muddle\", according to Roger Needham of the Cambridge\\nComputer Laboratory. The greatest successes to arise from the muddle\\nso far are those using functions called prime factorisation\\nalgorithms. They are based on the mathematical insight that, while it\\nis easy to multiply two numbers together, it is very hard to work\\nbackwards to find the particular two numbers which were multiplied\\ntogether to produce some given number. If Alice chooses two large\\nprime numbers as her private key and publishes their 150-digit product\\nas her public key, it would probably take a code-breaker thousands of\\nyears to work backwards to calculate her private keys. A variety of\\nschemes have been worked out which use this insight as the basis for a\\nworkable public-key code.\\n\\nMost popular of these is the so-called RSA algorithm, named after the\\nthree MIT professors who created it - Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and\\nLen Adleman. It has been patented and is sold by a Silicon Valley\\ncompany, called RSA, that employs 15 people, most of them ex-MIT\\ngraduate students. Faculty firms are to computer start-ups what family\\nfirms were to the industrial revolution. RSA has attracted both\\nacademic praise and a range of heavyweight commercial customers:\\nMicrosoft, Sun Microsystems, Digital Equipment and Lotus Development.\\nBut, despite repeated applications, it has never been endorsed by\\nthose in government.\\n\\nRumours abound that the code-breakers in the National Security Agency\\nhave discouraged standard-setters from recommending RSA because they\\ndo not want to promote the use of codes they cannot break. RSA, for\\nobvious reasons, does not discourage the rumours. Whatever the reason,\\nthe standard-setters at the NIST have side-stepped the debate over RSA\\nwith their new algorithm, DSA. As set out in the standard, DSA\\nverifies the identity of the sender, but does not encrypt the message.\\nIt appends to the message a number calculated from the message and the\\nsender\\'s private key. The recipient can then use this number, the\\nmessage and the sender\\'s public key to verify that the message is what\\nit seems.\\n\\nThe NIST says that this technique is well suited to \"smart cards\" and\\nother applications where there is not a lot of computing power\\navailable for working out codes. Because it hopes that DSA Will be\\nused for verifying the identity of everyone from welfare recipients to\\nmilitary contractors, its flexibility is a boon. Meanwhile, however,\\nmore and more companies are choosing a public-key cryptography system\\nfor communicating confidentially - often RSA, sometimes something\\ndifferent. Someday, probably soon, governments will want to choose,\\ntoo.

Here\\'s a better try.\\n\\n\\tCygnus Support\\n\\t1937 Landings Drive\\n\\tMt. View, CA  94043\\n\\nThere\\'s no phone service there yet.\\n\\nTake US 101 toward Mt. View.  From San Francisco, it\\'s about a\\n40-minute drive.  Get off at the Rengstorff Ave/Amphitheatre Parkway\\nexit.  If you were heading south on 101, you curve around to the\\nright, cross over the freeway, and get to a stoplight.  If you were\\nheading north on 101, you just come right off the exit to the\\nstoplight.  The light is the intersection of Amphitheatre and\\nCharleston Rd.  Take a right on Charleston; there\\'s a right-turn-only\\nlane.\\n\\nFollow Charleston for a short distance.  You\\'ll pass the\\nMetaphor/Kaleida buildings on the right.  At a clump of palm trees and\\na \"Landmark Deli\" sign, you can take a right into Landings Drive; this\\ngets you into the complex from the north.  Or you can go slightly\\nfurther along Charleston and take the next right, into a driveway with\\na big \"Landmark\" sign in the middle.  No matter which way you got into\\nthe complex, follow around it until you are on the side that faces the\\nfreeway.  There\\'s a clock tower that rises out of one of the\\nbuildings, to the right (south) of the deli.  Enter through the doors\\nimmediately under the clock tower.  They\\'ll be open between noon and\\n1PM at least.  (See below if you\\'re late.)\\n\\nOnce inside, take the stairs up, immediately to your right.  At the top\\nof the stairs, turn right past the treetops, and we\\'ll be in 1937 on \\nyour left.\\n\\nIf you are late and the door under the clock tower is locked, you can\\ngo to the deli (which will be around a building and left, as you face\\nthe door), cut between the buildings to the right of the deli, and\\ninto the back lawns between the complex and the farm behind it.  Walk\\naround the buildings until you see a satellite dish in the lawn.  Go\\nup the stairs next to the dish, which are the back stairs into the\\nCygnus office space.  We\\'ll prop the door (or you can bang on it if we\\nforget).\\n\\nOr, you can find the guard who\\'s wandering around the complex, who\\nknows there\\'s a meeting happening and will let you in.  They can be\\nbeeped at 965 5250, though you\\'ll have trouble finding a phone.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget to eat first, or bring food at noon!  I recommend hitting\\nthe burrito place on Rengstorff (La Costen~a) at about 11:45.  To get\\nthere, when you get off 101, take Rengstorff (toward the hills) rather\\nthan Amphitheatre (toward the bay).  Follow it about ten blocks until\\nthe major intersection at Middlefield Road.  La Costen~a is the store\\non your left at the corner.  You can turn left into the narrow lane\\nbehind the store, which leads to a parking lot, and enter by the front\\ndoor, which faces the intersection.  To get to the meeting from there,\\njust retrace your route on Rengstorff, go straight over the freeway,\\nand turn right at the stoplight onto Charleston; see above.\\n\\nSee you there!\\n\\n\\tJohn Gilmore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Sat, 10 Oct 92 07:29:03 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: +-=*^\\nIn-Reply-To: <199210100906.AA26559@well.sf.ca.us>\\nMessage-ID: <9210101436.AA00257@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nGeorge recommends one-time pads.\\n\\nThe key distribution problem for one-time pads is *much* worse than\\nfor public key systems, or even conventional secret key ciphers for\\nthat matter.

The need\\nfor F2F meetings with all possible correspondents is something which exists\\nwith conventional ciphers.  The cost of key storage is trivial: a fraction\\nof the cost of the yearly (or less frequent) travel to meet each\\ncorrespondent in person.  Consider replaceable hard drive cartridges (30 meg\\nfor about a buck a meg), digital cassette formats including applications\\ninvolving videocassettes, and so on.  Yes, as you say, you have to exchange\\nkeys each time you run out of key; but you can keep ten years\\' with of key\\n(error: \"worth\" not \"with\") on hand if you like, taking up less physical\\nspace than a box of cookies.  \\n\\n\"Bandwidth required is much higher...\"  In what way?  Certainly not in terms\\nof transmission; a stream cipher is a stream cipher.  Perhaps in that each\\nplaintext character requires one key character?  This is just another\\nformulation of the \"storage\" issue: and again, if you have a stack of 30MB\\ncartridges, who cares?  Not like we\\'re talking about punched paper tape.\\n\\nI do agree that PKS offer convenience and features not available with\\nconventional ciphers.  However, RSA is just one mathematical breakthrough\\naway from being obsolete, and we have no way of knowing when that\\nbreakthrough occurs.  It may also be that massively parallel processors can\\nbe built through VLSI technology, allowing the cost of brute force solutions\\nto come down to a reasonable level.  \\n\\nAll of this is not by way of getting down on PKS.  I would suggest that we\\nneed a number of different systems, and need to keep them all in fairly\\nconstant use.  I think we\\'re already all in agreement that one of those\\nsystems should be RSA-based.  Now I\\'m just suggesting that a One-Time system\\nshould be another one among the many.\\n\\nBTW, sorry I couldn\\'t make today\\'s meeting; various local tasks demanding\\nattention; plus physical travel distance.

One time pads are very\\nexpensive on a per-link basis than public key systems for this reason\\nonly.  Per-link is one person-to-person link.\\n\\n   Consider replaceable hard drive cartridges (30 meg\\n   for about a buck a meg), digital cassette formats including applications\\n   involving videocassettes, and so on.  \\n\\nSuppose one cartridge per link.  That\\'s $30 per link.

In the case of cartridges, the UPS cost to ship one is\\nstill only about 1/5 of the cost of a cartridge.  A 3 1/2 inch floppy\\ncan be shipped for one or two ounces of postage.\\n\\n   However, RSA is just one mathematical breakthrough\\n   away from being obsolete, and we have no way of knowing when that\\n   breakthrough occurs.\\n\\nIt is also one breakthrough away from being known to be fully secure.\\nNot only do we not know when that will happen, we don\\'t know which\\nwill happen.\\n\\n   It may also be that massively parallel processors can\\n   be built through VLSI technology, allowing the cost of brute force solutions\\n   to come down to a reasonable level.  \\n\\nLook at the figures for best know factoring algorithms.  Now estimate\\nthe total amount of silicon output per annum in the US and estimate\\nit\\'s computational ability.  I think you\\'ll find that it would still\\ntake on the order of years to factor a single 1024 bit modulus.\\n\\nThe difficulty of hard problems and the scale of the solar system are\\ntwo things which are both extremely difficult to get any intuition\\nabout.\\n\\n   I would suggest that we need a number of different systems, and\\n   need to keep them all in fairly constant use.

Perfect security is\\nnot worth the cost in time, effort, or dollars when the marginal cost\\nof perfection is less than the marginal benefit.\\n\\nEven SWIFT, the international monetary wire transfer system, does not\\nuse one time pads for link encryption.  Now here is a network which\\nbreaking into would be worth billions (that\\'s thousands of millions,\\nlet me remind you).  The chief executives of SWIFT exchanges keys by\\npost.  \\n\\nOne time pads are useful for all sorts of things, but they are very\\nexpensive to use.  They are useful in protocols for blinding and key\\nexchanges.  They do not seem to be useful for end-to-end link\\nencryption, however.\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Mon, 12 Oct 92 08:20:43 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Next meeting: Nov. 21\\nMessage-ID: <9210121527.AA23015@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nThe next physical cypherpunks meeting was decided on Saturday at\\nthat meeting.

In order to be\\nsuccessful, this needs to be not just a development project, but also\\na marketing campaign.

Now if I might try to salvage my position...\\n\\n\"One time pads are very (much more) expensive on a per-link basis than\\npublic key systems...\"  \\n\\nYes, of course.  However I don\\'t envision OTPs as a standard for bulk\\nencryption on large networks.  Rather, for person-to-person communication in\\nsmall networks.  Examples: a group of civil rights attorneys suing the\\nFederal govt., an international environmental organisation\\'s main offices in\\nthe capital cities of a small number of countries, etc.  Cases where the\\nadversary is one or more powerful governments, and the number of links\\nrequired is relatively small.  Given the nature of the relationships between\\nthese kinds of networks and their adversaries, the expense would seem to be\\njustified; in any case, the **incremental** cost of for instance a set of\\n30MB cartridges as compared to a few floppy discs, is an minor fraction of\\nthe cost of the airline tickets and other expenses for trusted couriers.\\n(oops: \"a minor fraction...\")\\n\\nYour discussion of bandwidth can be met with a similar counter-arguement.\\nFirst of all, I would reject the use of UPS or (God help us) the *Post\\nOffice* as a courier, particularly where one or more governments may be the\\nadversaries against whom protection is needed.  \\nSo your reference to those carriers is not relevant to the main point of my\\ncase.  I\\'m assuming that key materials are transported by trusted courier\\nand are guarded by same until they reach their intended recipient.  Okay,\\nthat *really* drives up the cost, doesn\\'t it...?  Not if the key materials\\n\"hitch hike\" on an existing travel plan: attorney A flies out to city B to\\nvisit attorney B... and happens to carry key material onboard in his/her\\nshoulder bag.  No added cost except for the storage devices, and that is not\\nsignificant.  \\n\\nRe mathematical breakthroughs in factoring etc, you say, \"we don\\'t know when\\nthat will happen, and we don\\'t know which will happen.\"  Exactly my point.\\n*We* don\\'t know.  But the NSA and so on, most certainly do know, and they\\nwon\\'t be telling.  If the breakthrough comes, then the period between that\\npoint and the point when it is publicised, will be one of false security.\\nWas it Kahn who said nothing is more dangerous than a bad cipher?  My point\\nhere comes down to nothing more or less than the principle of caution in the\\nface of an unknown.  \\n\\n(Discussion of relative cost of brute force solutions, and the question of\\nhard problems and scale.)  I agree that my intuition about these things may\\nbe highly flawed. However this doesn\\'t invalidate my point about the\\npossibility of basic breakthroughs happening behind closed doors.  Now in a\\nway I\\'ll admit that my arguement here sort of comes down to a black box.\\nHowever, again I would assert that there are cases where the almost\\nirrational caution is worthwhile.  \\n\\nYou say in concluding, \"Perfect security is not worth the cost in time,\\neffort, or dollars when the marginal cost of perfection is less (do you mean\\nmore?) than perfection.\"  You cite examples of international banking\\nsystems.\\n\\nI would cite examples of political movements which have been sabotaged and\\ndestroyed by government covert action.  One need not look far to run into\\nCOINTELPRO and the more recent French govt action of blowing up a Greenpeace\\nvessel.  Where your adversaries are the intelligence agencies of world\\npowers, and where lives are at stake, I would say the cost of perfect\\nsecurity is justified.  Now of course, the French terrorist bombing, the\\ndestruction of Black nationalist and student organising groups in the US,\\nand other examples, may not (probably would not) have been prevented\\naltogether by adoption of perfect communications security.  Che Guevara\\nafter all used OTPs, and it was radio direction finding and traffic analysis\\n(rather than cryptanalysis) which ultimately led to his murder by US-backed\\nmercenaries.  \\n\\nIf we are promoting a tendency which is inherently political, it implicitly\\nrecognises governments as its adversaries.  Our choices of cryptographic\\nsystems should reflect a wide range of applications and not exclude some\\na-priori on grounds of cost or convenience.  \\n\\n-George (gg@well.sf.ca.us)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: George A.

The FidoNet environment is a\\nlittle different than other nets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* Security and authentication using PGP in FidoNet\\n\\nTHOUGHTS ON SECURITY AND AUTHENTICATION\\nFOR EMAIL SYSTEMS\\nTom Jennings (1:125/111)\\n\\n\\n\\nSome ideas on public key security systems. To sum up ahead of time, I\\nassert that the public broadcasting of public keys is more than\\nenough security and authentication for casual, privacy needs in the\\nFidoNet or other email network.\\n\\nAll of this article assumes the use of PGP version 2.0, the RSA\\ndouble-key encryption system implemented as freeware.\\n\\n\\nThis is all new to most of us, this security/privacy thing. Both\\ntechnologically and socially. What privacy we have we take for granted\\nwithout much thought; letters in envelopes, \"who is it?\" to knocks on\\nthe door, etc. When we try to break down these things into their\\nunderlying assumptions, well, it\\'s hard. We shouldn\\'t get upset with\\nourselves or others if \"we don\\'t get it\" right away. And we\\'ll find\\nsome obvious things aren\\'t, and vice versa.\\n\\nI will assume that if you really, really need utter absolute security,\\nyou can achieve that with PGP or whatever. If it\\'s that sensitive,\\nsending it over an electronic medium probably isn\\'t recommended. This\\narticle isn\\'t about how to achieve bank-vault security.\\n\\nWithin the FidoNet, the most common use we all seem to talk about is\\nPRIVACY, rather than SECURITY. I can only speak for myself, but, my\\nnetmail (not echomail) traffic is probably a reasonable example.  I\\nread about 100 messages a week, and send out about 50. There\\'s a dozen\\nor so people I talk with regularly, and about 50 per week that I do\\nnot know. Most of it is of the \"Oh yeah, so and so said this. How\\'s\\nyour mother. Did you get that file OK...\". Even if an eavesdropper\\nread this stuff, I would barely care. \\n\\nThere are some times though when revealed message contents could be...\\npersonally compromising. Embarrassing. A real life example: a long\\ntime ago, a sysop in a net was having trouble with their net host.\\nSome messages critical of that net host were intercepted by the host,\\nsome passed on, and some we each got replies to! Not Good. \\n\\nWhat *I* want is a way to ensure that sometimes, only the addressee\\ncan read a given message. I am willing to pay some penalty for this,\\nbut I won\\'t live with a system that restrains me like a stone castle\\nand moat. My needs and risks just aren\\'t that great.\\n\\nWith that as a background assumption, let\\'s look at two separate\\nissues that look at first to be the same -- SECURITY and\\nAUTHENTICATION.\\n\\n\\nSECURITY -- given an encrypted message, how likely is it that someone\\ncan ascertain what\\'s inside it (assuming you\\'re not the addressor or\\naddressee)?  As an operating assumption, I will take it for granted\\nthat PGP produces files that are secure in themselves (barring bugs,\\netc). Like the docs say, a frontal cryptological assault is hard, and\\nin our casual privacy case, probably not what we\\'ve got to worry\\nabout.\\n\\nThere are other ways to figure out what\\'s going on. Imagine you\\'re\\nthat net host. You\\'ve had trouble with this particular sysop before.\\nYou notice he\\'s just sent a flurry of messages to the local RC, then\\nthe ZC. Hmmm!! Do you really need to know what\\'s in those messages?!\\n(This is called traffic analysis. In pre-WWII Germany, the Nazis\\ntracked down \"Jew sympathizers\" with traffic analysis of telephone\\nbilling information; Europeans don\\'t get itemized phone bills any\\nlonger... like here in the US. So I was told, the information is no\\nlonger kept. (Do I really believe that...:-))\\n\\nAnyways, security is more than cryptographic strength. Turns out,\\nthere\\'s a way around this: anonymous remailers. In a private Internet\\nmailing list Eric Hughes came up with a trick to anonymously remail\\nmessages; you send mail destined for system X to the remailer instead;\\nit strips off the header info and mails it to system X.  Anonymity\\nisn\\'t really needed though in the case above, simple remailing will\\ndo. Again, our *general* FidoNet needs are modest.\\n\\n\\n\\nAUTHENTICATION is the sticky one for us. Authentication is\\ndetermining: is this person really the person they say they are? But I\\nthink you\\'ll see it isn\\'t the fatal problem it appears to be at first.\\n\\nLet\\'s get the obvious case out of the way first again: if you need\\nutter and absolute security, you better damn well know the person\\nahead of time, you should get a key delivered by hand, and you should\\nthink about if you really want to conduct business over an electronic\\nlink in the first place. Authentication in this case isn\\'t -- or\\nshouldn\\'t be! -- a problem.\\n\\nFor our relatively-casual privacy use, authentication is almost moot.\\nSome people I have already exchanged keys with, *I\\'ve never met face\\nto face in my life* and may never. In spite of this I feel I know\\nthem. I trust or assume that they are who they say they are. This is\\nthe environment we need to work in.\\n\\nThis, plus the fact that we\\'ve got (at the moment) some 16,000\\npotential keys, means we simply can\\'t do the full-blast security\\nthing. How much \"security\" can I expect, or need, with someone I\\'ve\\nnever met? Consider again the utter-security case again.\\n\\nBut the bottom line is in fact already taken care of, PGP or not --\\nhow do you know that \"the real Tom Jennings\" wrote this article? Our\\nunderlying social system, so frequently overlooked, takes care of it.\\nYou can assume I, and many people who have been in the net, are\\nverifiable. You have a number of ways to determine if I really wrote\\nthis article. Simply asking via FidoNet will uncover most fakes.\\nLooking at old nodelists to see what info on my name has changed. Ask\\npeople who might know me. And so on. \\n\\nIf our public keys are scattered to the wind like plants scatter\\npollen, it is certainly possible that I could fake \"your\" public key,\\nand gain access through all the methods discussed in detail in the\\nliterature.  However, assuming the real person and the fake person(s)\\nare both generating keys (and using them to sign and send messages),\\nthe more keyrings were passed around the chances of detecting the\\nincompatible keys becomes almost certain. At that point, even a casual\\neffort would be able to track it down, to at least determine that\\nthere *was* a fake.\\n\\nExample: Mary has been using PGP for a few months, and conversing with\\nfriends and acquaintances. Her public key is filerequestable, and\\nprobably appears on a hundred keyrings. \\n\\nOver the next few months, other people get messages from \"Mary\" making\\nincreasingly odd claims, via encrypted mail. The impostors fake key,\\nin order to be useful at all, would also have to be widely\\ndistributed.\\n\\nCurious, someone sends Mary a message encrypted with what appears to\\nbe her public key, and a plaintext one telling her that the\\ncyphertext was encrypted with her public key, and that he suggests if\\nshe can\\'t decipher it someone may have faked her key.\\n\\nWhat Mary actually does depends on many things. If she has indeed\\nbeen creating the crazy messages, well, the problem\\'s elsewhere. If\\nshe finds she can\\'t read the message, her recourse depends on what is\\navailable to her: if there are public key repositories, she would be\\nadvised to contact them and notify them of the alleged faked key(s),\\nand follow whatever process is setup to generate a new key.\\n\\nThe very knowledge of key collision would be enough to flag to users\\nthat there\\'s a potential problem.\\n\\n\\nThere are more practical issues that limit our need for traditional\\nsecurity measures on keys.\\n\\nEven if you stored your private key on disk, it would take physical\\naccess of your machine to get it. This is not what I\\'m worried about\\nin private FidoNet mail. If a FidoNet member tries to break into my\\nhouse or system to get at my key, I\\'ve got other troubles! \\n\\nPractically speaking, it might even be a good idea to have two keys; a\\nsmall (256 bit) one for casual, email privacy, and a big one (1024\\nbits) that you give to people by hand on diskette. The small key will\\nmean better performance, more important on bulk casual email, and\\ncertainly adequate against eavesdropping. For high-security needs,\\nwhich most people don\\'t have (I certainly  don\\'t), the performance\\npenalty probably won\\'t matter as much.\\n\\nThe worst part of security systems is that people will *rely* on them\\nas absolutes. This is the only thing that makes a faked, encrypted\\nmessage worse than a faked, plaintext message.\\n\\nAgain, it\\'s important to remember the goal (as if we could ever\\npossibly agree to a *single* goal...) -- if it\\'s privacy, the ability\\nto stop eavesdroppers, then a broadcast public key system is more than\\nadequate, and public key repositories even better. If you want a\\nmaximum-security vault, you take added precautions. No one system will\\nsolve all problems. I\\'m a firm believer in a broadcast public key\\nsystem for email.\\n\\n\\n\\nPRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR PGP USE IN FIDONET PRIVACY:\\n\\n * Use small (256 bit) keys for routine, low-security use, such as\\nnetmail privacy with people you don\\'t know personally (and don\\'t get\\nkeys from physically).\\n\\n * Public key encryption is most useful for email, ie. FidoNet\\nnetmail, especially when it flows through multiple hosts on its way\\nto its destination.\\n\\n * The current password scheme for echomail links is proven to be\\nadequate to safeguard what is basically a public forum, anyways.\\nFurther security doesn\\'t seem to be needed on these links.\\n\\n * When adding keys received via FidoNet to your public keyring,\\nanswer \"do you want to certify this key yourself\" with NO, unless you\\nreceived the key by hand. It doesn\\'t hurt the usefulness of the key\\nitself; however, if someone later uses your public keyring they won\\'t\\nbe lulled into a false security. (Certification of keys can be done\\nat any time.)\\n\\n * Passing keyrings around willy-nilly, though counter to \"good\\nsecurity practice\" in traditional uses is actually a good thing for\\nus. \"Key Repositories\" scattered throughout the net (each exchanging\\nkeyrings as well as posting lists of \"trouble keys\") is a better idea.\\n\\n * Reserve large (1024 bit) keys for people who you know, and can\\nensure security in traditional ways (some pointed out in the PGP\\ndocumentation). \\n\\n* As seems to be developing, have your public key filerequestable as\\nmagicname \"PGPKEY\" (your own public key only), and your keyring as\\n\"KEYRING\" (all of your public keys). These should be ASCII-armor\\nfiles (PGP -kxa)\\n\\n\\n * Origin: World Power Systems / FidoNews / San Francisco CA (1:125/111)\\n--  \\nTom Jennings - via FidoNet node 1:125/555\\n    UUCP: ...!uunet!hoptoad!kumr!fidogate!111!Tom.Jennings\\nINTERNET: Tom.Jennings@f111.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: \"Fen Labalme\" <fen@genmagic.com>\\nDate: Tue, 13 Oct 92 15:56:27 PDT\\nTo: \"Cypher Punks\" <cypherpunks@toad.com>\\nSubject: anonymous bank accounts via\\nMessage-ID: <9210132256.AA08647@relay2.UU.NET>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nMail*Link( Remote             anonymous bank accounts via pem\\n\\nFYI:\\n\\n[pem-dev is a private email list for developers of the Privacy Enhanced\\nMail protocol additions to Internet mail, originally published as RFCs\\n1113 - 1115, and now updated as four draft-ietf-pem documents.

This is what I\\'ve found.\\n\\nFirst, Eric\\'s descriptions of how all the different software\\ncomponents work together have been very helpful.  The software\\nhas gone through three revisions as Eric added new features, so\\nI implemented them in that order - first the basic remailer,\\nthen adding the \"##\" and \"::\" support for header management.\\n\\n(I had to get perl and slocal before I could get started.\\nLuckily my system already uses sendmail.)\\n\\nBasically, I was able to put the parts together the way Eric\\ndescribed and have it work.  I was able to send messages and\\nhave them remailed.  I even did some tests bouncing mail between\\nmy remailer and Eric\\'s.\\n\\nThen I tried adding a new feature to the remailer - automatic\\nmessage decryption using PGP.  It\\'s not really very secure since\\nanyone with root privileges at my site can see my pass phrase,\\nbut my site is pretty isolated (a 2400 baud modem is the only link\\nto the outside world).  For this I had to add one line to Eric\\'s\\nmodel .maildelivery file to invoke my PGP filter, and had to write\\nabout a five line shell script to run PGP in a useful way.  I\\nam still tuning this a little bit but I can send the exact scripts\\nout when people are ready for them.\\n\\nOne nice thing about this is that, with my remailer plus Eric\\'s,\\nand with the decryption option, you can now send anonymous messages\\nfor which no one person can tell that you did it.  What you would\\ndo is to send the message first through Eric\\'s remailer, so I\\ndon\\'t know where it came from, then through my remailer, but with\\nthe message encrypted so that Eric can\\'t tell where it\\'s going after\\nit leaves me.  If more people will run remailers then we\\'ll have\\nmuch more security.\\n\\nI will now tell you how to use it, in case you want to experiment.\\nBut remember that all messages are going across an intermittently-\\npolled 2400 baud modem, so don\\'t expect fast turnaround and please\\ndon\\'t send a large volume of messages.  Also, please don\\'t pass\\ninformation about this remailer beyond this list, for now.\\n\\nThe remailer is at hal@ghs.com.  The basic remailing operation is\\nas Eric has described: either put \"Request-Remailing-To: <dest>\" in\\nthe header of the message, or put, as the first two lines of the\\nbody of your message:\\n\\n::\\nRequest-Remailing-To: <dest>\\n\\nAnd follow these two lines with a blank line, then the message to\\nbe forwarded.\\n\\nDecryption is just a little complicated.  The thing to remember is\\nthat you want to do more than just have me decrypt the message.  You\\nwant me to then remail the message after decryption.  This means\\nthat you should prepare a message with remailing instructions as\\nabove, then encrypt the whole thing, including the \"::\" and\\n\"Request-Remailing-To:\" lines.  Encrypt using PGP with the public\\nkey I show below, and use the -a flag for Ascii output.\\n\\nThis will create a PGP output file, typically with the extension .asc.\\nThe first line will be:\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\\n\\nNow, you can send this message to me, but you have to do one more\\nthing.  You have to mark it as an encrypted message, by putting the\\nline \"Encrypted: PGP\" in the header.  If you can\\'t put stuff into\\nthe headers of messages, then use Eric\\'s \"::\" feature and add the\\nfollowing two lines, then a blank line, before \"-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\":\\n\\n::\\nEncrypted: PGP\\n\\nDon\\'t forget the blank line after these two.\\n\\nNow, this message can be sent to my remailer.  It will be decrypted\\nand then remailed to whomever you requested.\\n\\nI know this sounds complicated, so let me break it down into steps:\\n\\n  1. Create the message.\\n\\n  2. Add \"::\" and \"Request-Remailing-To: <dest>\" and a blank line to the\\n\\ttop.\\n\\n  3. Encrypt the whole file using PGP and the public key below.\\n\\n  4. Add \"::\" and \"Encrypted: PGP\" and a blank line to the top of\\n  \\tthe encrypted file.\\n\\n  5. Send it to hal@ghs.com.\\n\\nThat\\'s not so bad, is it?\\n\\nNow, if you\\'re really adventurous, here\\'s how to do the double-remailing\\nprocess I described above, the one which keeps any one remailer from\\nknowing who\\'s talking to whom.\\n\\n  1. Create the message.\\n\\n  2. Add \"::\" and \"Request-Remailing-To: <dest>\" and a blank line to the\\n\\ttop.\\n\\n  3. Encrypt the whole file using PGP and the public key below.\\n\\n  4. Add \"::\" and \"Request-Remailing-To: hal@ghs.com\", then a blank line,\\n  \\tthen \"##\" then \"Encrypted: PGP\", then a blank line, to the top of\\n  \\tthe encrypted file.\\n  \\n  5. Send it to hughes@soda.berkeley.edu\\n\\nThe only complicated step is step 4, where you put in the remailing\\nrequest to go from Eric\\'s system to mine, and use the \"##\" line so\\nthat the outgoing message has \"Encrypted: PGP\" in the header.\\n\\nIf you want real security, encrypt the message using your friend\\'s\\npublic key after step 1 and send that.  Then nobody will even know\\nwhat you\\'re saying, let alone who you\\'re talking to.\\n\\nAs promised, here\\'s the public key for my remailer:\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nVersion: 2.01\\n\\nmQBNAirY9EoAAAEB/iuDBqpeJ8gsNQwJNRYWBxH7uP95ApQ92CDhCmuSEJ0Tta0l\\noCrC+8Br+D7Nfotb7hJlI0A1CYGAlmCsRO8VEmkABRO0H1JlbWFpbGluZyBTZXJ2\\naWNlIDxoYWxAZ2hzLmNvbT6JAJUCBRAq2ISQqBMDr1ghTDcBARYlBADCjkCkIDvA\\n7QFtpYUlYjz/2U+/oDuMZBDlmAw8BCg3sdJG7hnxPE4yVgKoH/ozsb23pbFTPB8H\\nWNEjqTqixNybOKSKH9T8iCaRDA8+bS6xPN4YlWKD/Wg2EiyuOjD3v/vWgiZXzMR5\\nhpe0CYVJ6bM++hptXu+JxqDReJIot5FFbQ==\\n=p8FS\\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\n\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\nP.S.

The importance of trading physical goods in the Crypto Anarchy\\nGame.\\n\\nThis, in my view, has been given undue and misleading importance.\\nPhysical goods are inherently easy to trace through remailers (via\\nsniffers, radioactive tracers, weight of packages, and many other\\nphysical cues), are hard to store physically (imagine getting 100\\nparcels for later remailing), and, most importantly, have none of the\\n\"envelope within envelope within....\" protection accorded to the bits\\nof a cryptographic remailing, or DC-Net, system! The elegance of\\ncryptographic protocols is lost with physical goods.\\n\\nFurthermore, physical delivery of any good, whether drugs, stolen\\nmissile components, antiquities and art items, whatever, is\\nfundamentally a hard problem to solve...smugglers and thieves have\\nbeen dealing this since the beginning of time. Stings can be easily\\narranged, delivery is not anonymous (one merely watches who takes\\ndelivery, or who opens a train station locker, etc....this is all SOP\\nfor narcs and counterespionage types), and a raid on a remailing\\nentity will result in confiscation of the physical goods and (likely)\\nprosecution of those caught holding the stuff. (Raiding a bit\\nremailing entity produces only random-appearing bits...granted, the\\nauthorities may well outlaw bit remailing, or use the RICO and\\nconspiracy/sedition laws to prosecute, but that\\'s another topic.)\\n\\nOur recent emphasis on physical goods, and all the ideas pouring in on\\nwhat other kinds of \"contraband\" besides drugs can be used, is\\nmisleading. None of the richness of the cryptographic world is\\nfaithfully preserved. I urge we get back to our roots and deal only\\nwith things that can be expressed purely in bit form. \\n\\n2. The \"colonization of cyberspace\" does not mean there is no\\ninteraction with the physical world, of course. But that interaction\\ncan be mediated with money made by converting information or digital\\nmoney into physical money. Several methods for this conversion path\\ncan be considered:\\n\\n-Alice sells information in the cyberspace domain for the equivalent\\nof, say, $30,000. She converts this to \"real\" dollars by using an\\nescrow entity which hold both sides of the transaction until it\\'s\\ncompleted. They then mail the information to the purchaser and send an\\nordinary check \"for services rendered\" to Alice for $30K. She reports\\nit on her taxes, probably as a \"consulting fee\" (for which essentially\\nno government supervision currently exists, nor is likely to....), and\\nthe conversion has taken place.  (Note: there are still elements of\\ntrust involved, notably involving the escrow agent, but trust works\\npretty well for many things, especially when reputations are at\\nstake. Understanding how real businesses depend on reputations is a\\nmissing part of modern cryptology analyses of transactions...the\\nprotocol analyzers and number theorists almost never take into account\\nhow reputations work in the real world, But I digress.)\\n\\n-Alice and Bob trade information such that Bob gets the information\\nworth about $30K, as above, and Alice gets another piece of\\ninformation she can use in the \"real world\" that is worth about $30K.\\nThis might be stock tips, or, better, information she can turn around\\nand sell in the \"open market\" of a service like AMIX!  There are lots\\nof wrinkles, inefficiencies, etc., to be worked out.\\n\\n-And then there is digital money. You all know about this, or should.\\nDavid Chaum, DigiCash, blinded notes, credentials, etc. The handout\\nfor the first meeting had a glossary of terms. (IMHO, we should be\\nspending more of our time at our meeting discussing this, and less in\\nplaying more interations of the Game.)\\n\\nThe fascinating novel \"Snow Crash,\" by Neil Stephenson, makes a\\nmistake in having Hiro Protagonist a very wealthy man in the Metaverse\\n(Stephenson\\'s term for the virtual reality cyberspace) but a very poor\\nman in the Real World. Information _is_ money. Information is liquid,\\nflows across borders, and is generally convertible into real money.\\n(One simple conversion strategy, alluded to above, is for Alice to\\nsell her information for, say, $500K, and then to receive a\\n\"consulting contract,\" perhaps called a \"retainer,\" of $50K a year for\\nthe next 20 years. Her retainer is fully legal, is perhaps handled\\nthrough cut-outs who specialize in this kind of thing, and is a\\nlow-risk way to \"launder\" money from cyberspace into the real world. I\\nhave a lot more to say on these schemes, perhaps later.)\\n\\n3. Are we emphasizing \"The Game\" too much?\\n\\nIf the goal is to produce a paper-based game, similar to \"Monopoly\" or\\nfantasy role-playing games, then I suppose more practice is needed.\\nBut I\\'m not sure how worthwhile it is to try to design such a game.\\n(Those who wish to should do so, then commercialize it, and become the\\nAvalon Hill of crypto games!)\\n\\nIf the goal is educational, for newly interested folks, then I also\\nquestion how much more effort should be put into it. The ideas of\\nanonymous remailers, of digital money, etc., are, I think, gotten\\nacross in the first 60 minutes of the game, especially if some of the\\nformalism is first explained (as it was at the first game, where\\ndigital mixes, tamper-resistand modules for implementing mixes, the\\n\"Dining Cryptographers Protocol,\" and digital money had all been\\nfreshly covered, so participants were putting the theory to test).\\n\\n\\nI found the first game was instructive, the second much less so (and\\n_not_ because of the focus on drug selling...that was a relatively\\nminor issue). My impression is that many of the newcomers--and they\\nshould jump in here with their own reactions (too bad we don\\'t have\\nhypertext links!)--didn\\'t really know how remailing mixes work, how\\ndigital psueodnyms can protect privacy in transactions, and how the\\n\"Game\" was intended to exercise these concepts.\\n\\n4. We need to talk about the charter or purpose of the \"Cypherpunks\"\\nor \"Cryptology Amateurs for Social Irresponsibility\" (CASI--Eric\\nHughes\\'s term) group.\\n\\n-Is it mostly educational?\\n-Is it a lobbying group, as are EFF, CPSR, and the like?\\n-Is it to produce remailers, digital money, and other programming?\\n-Is it subversive?\\n\\nNow clearly we can\\'t say it\\'s subversive (any bets on who\\'s gatewaying\\nthese messages to Other Listeners?). But we also don\\'t want to skew\\nthings toward \"YALG\" (Yet Another Lobbying Group), nor do we want to\\nbe a spoon-feeding educational group for people with a casual (and\\ntransient) interest in crypto stuff.\\n\\n5. There have have been several messages so far about worries about\\nthe legal implications of these topics, about how some\\ncorporate-affiliated subscribers will desubscribe \"real fast\" if\\ncertain discussion trends continue, and so on. Now we can\\'t please\\neverybody, but maybe we ought to talk about this sensitive issue soon,\\nand _in person_.\\n\\nSince it relates to our charter, Point 4 above, I recommend we do this\\nat our next meeting. I\\'d favor that over another iteration of the\\nGame.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we are in at the beginning of Something Big. While I\\'m\\nsomewhat skeptical about the claims for things like nanotech, I see\\nthis whole cyberspace/cryptology/digital money/transnationalism ball of\\nwax being _much_ easier to implement. Networks are multiplying beyond\\nany hope of government control, bandwidths are skyrocketing, CPUs are\\nputting awesome power on our desktops, PGP is generating incredible\\ninterest, and social trends are making the time right for crypto\\nanarchy.\\n\\nI look forward to hearing your views.\\n\\n\\n--\\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

Lenny had never met any of the people who had scouted out \\nthe plant, nor the bitter, out-of-work engineer who had figured out how \\nto wreck it, and none of the operators who were involved would meet each \\nother.  Made for hard-to-crack operations.  Some people on the east coast \\ndid the same for the covert side of the GreenRage group that paid Lenny. \\n\\n     The tofu sandwich he had for breakfast was a dim memory.\\n \\n     \"Lunch first.\" Lenny thought.\\n \\n     As he headed out to pick up a vegetarian pizza, he looked through \\nthe little glass panels in the front door. \\n      \\n     \"Oh, shit, suits outside,\"\\n\\n     Lenny said it with feeling, but kept his voice down.  He turned on \\nhis heel in the hall leading to the front door and ran back into the \\ngrubby GreenRage office in the dining room of a rented house in San \\nSamon.  He managed to hit the power switch on the PC at Stel\\'s desk \\nbefore the door opened.  Stel was in the bathroom.  Whether she heard the \\nwarning or not, Lenny could get no help from her, and Marge was out on \\nerrands.  The door was opening--there was no chance to get to the other \\ntwo computers or to take down the \\'586 file server in the kitchen--he \\nlooked up and in his best bright and cheerful voice (which to Lenny \\nsounded hollow and rehearsed) said, \"May I help you?\" \\n    \\n      The first of the four suits, a beefy dude in a grey outfit spoke up. \\n\\n     \"Yes, you can.  We\\'re from the CCA.  (The Computer Control Agency):  \\nWe have a court order to copy all the computer files in this building,\" \\n(he held up an official looking piece of paper--more trees destroyed, \\nthought Lenny.) \"so unless you want to be charged with contempt, you can \\nstep back from that computer, and don\\'t touch anything till we are done.\" \\n\\n     Lenny stepped back.  He wasn\\'t as terrified as he could have been, \\nthough his heart rate must have been close to 120 and his mouth was dry. \\nHe had been through raid drills and a few real confrontations with the \\nlaw at pickets and bleed-ins. \\n\\n     \"At least it isn\\'t a search warrant, we might keep operating\" he \\nthought.  Then remembering the drill, spoke up: \\n\\n     \"Can I see the order?\"  \\n\\n     The beefy one handed it over while his three leaner and younger \\ncompanions fanned out to the computers.  They obviously knew where the \\ncomputers were, but that did not necessarily mean rot in the \\norganization.  How well they coped with the \\'puters would say something \\nabout that. \\n\\n     The paper was about what he expected, an order signed by a judge to \\ncopy every storage device in the GreenRage\\'s office to an encrypted WORM \\ndrive.  The box for paper documents wasn\\'t checked, so they knew they \\nwouldn\\'t find anything useful on paper.  Bad sign, it meant they knew \\nmore about GreenRage than Lenny liked.  \"Waste as much time as I can,\" \\nLenny thought to himself, and in a very polite voice he asked:\\n\\n     \"Can I see some ID for you and your men? \\n\\n     The closest of the technoids, as Lenny thought of them looked up in \\ndisgust after putting his hand on the back of the ancient \\'386 clone \\nLenny had just killed.  \\n\\n     \"Its been turned off in the last 2 minutes.  Did you do it when we \\ncame in?\" he said this looking right into Lenny\\'s eyes, while digging out \\nhis badge. Lenny didn\\'t lie with his reply, \\n\\n     \"Its Stel\\'s, she was about to go out, and we try to save power by \\nturning them off when we go out.\"  He said this as loud as he dared, \\nhoping that Stel would hear him in the bathroom, then spoke up even \\nlouder, \\n\\n     \"Stel, we have official visitors, so don\\'t make any sudden moves.\" \\n\\n     At 200+ pounds, and fifty plus years, Stel didn\\'t make many fast \\nmoves, unless they were on young guys.  In view of the constant water \\nshortage, the chances were only about one in four that she would flush \\nthe toilet, and less than even that Stel would wash her hands.  Without \\nany running water sounds, she come out. \\n\\n     \"Pigs, huh.\"  Stel had been politically imprinted as an anarchist at \\nMadison over thirty years ago in the late \\'60s and early 70\\'s.  When it \\nsuited her, she could be one of the most obnoxious people Lenny had ever \\nknown.  At least it diverted the attention from him, chances were low \\nthat the cops would grill Stel on who shut off the power on her computer. \\n\\n     Beefy, whose\\' badge claimed to be one Dan Barker, and technoid #1 \\n(Lenny never did get a name for him, flashed their badges. Lenny grabbed \\na whiteboard marker (almost dry, and the only non computer writing device \\npermitted in the office) and scribbled Barker\\'s name and badge number on \\nthe edge of a badly cluttered whiteboard.  The other two technoids had \\nfanned out, one to Lenny\\'s desk, and the other to the kitchen.  The \\nkitchen one came back shaking his head. \\n\\n     \"No damn keyboard or display on the server.  Have to go in through \\nthe other ones to dump the disk.\" \\n\\n     Technoid #2 moved the mouse on Marge\\'s machine, but thank the green \\nmother, thought Lenny, the screensaver program had timed out, and the \"I \\nNEED A PASSWORD!\" message came up.  That meant the password was gone from \\nmemory on that machine.  Technoid #3 hit paydirt on Lenny\\'s machine: the \\nscreen was still alive.  He hit the space bar, and pulled out a little \\nalarm timer which he set to go off every 3 minutes. \"Damn, damnit\" \\nthought Lenny, \"I should have set the timeout shorter, has it really been \\nless than 5 minutes since I got up?\"  And he was mentally kicking himself \\nfor not wiping the password when he got up. \\n\\n     Technoid #3 noted the directory (ACIDRAIN/TRMINATE) where Lenny had \\nbeen working and went back up, a level at a time to the main directory on \\nthe file server.  He seemed prepared to deal with a no printer machine, \\npulling out a pad of paper from a little portfolio (more trees!) and \\nstarted making notes on the directory structure. \\n\\n     Technoid #2 looked up from Marge\\'s machine and asked Lenny, \\n\\n     \"I don\\'t suppose you would know the password?\" \\n\\n     Lenny shook his head and then looked the agent in the eye.\\n\\n     \"No sir! I certainly wouldn\\'t know Marge\\'s password to get into her \\npersonal machine!\" And wouldn\\'t admit it if I did know, he thought. \\n\\n     Technoid #2 looked over at Stel frowning at the machine on her desk \\nand asked mildly, \\n\\n    \"I don\\'t suppose you would remember your password?\" \\n\\n    \"Fuck off sharp one,\" Stel said with a straight face.  Even in a near \\nstate of panic, Lenny got a flash of amusement as Beefy started to spit \\nout a hot reply.  Beefy checked himself as he saw #2 write down \\nfuckoff#1.  Stel grinned slightly; she had almost scored one on the \\nagents. \\n\\n    Without making a move toward Stel\\'s machine, #2 asked #3, \\n\\n    \"Shall I try it, Jim?\"  Jim was engrossed, paging through directories \\nbut he mumbled: \\n\\n    \"No, let\\'s see what I can get before we risk a password given under \\nduress.\" And, half a minute later, \\n\\n    \"This is going to be a bitch, I can\\'t find any programs to dump \\nmemory, no debug, no basic, no smalltalk, no turbo, nothing.\"  Lenny \\ngrinned, and straightened his face with an effort.  The crypt program had \\ncome with instructions to delete or encrypt under a special key a long \\nlist of compilers and interpreters-- not that he understood exactly what \\nthey were anyway. \\n\\n     \"Bob, could you have one of the uniformed officers get the camera \\nout of the car?  Looks like we are going to have to photograph some of \\nthis.\"  Beefy went to the door and tried to get the attention of one of \\nthe uniformed cops that had come with them.  No luck, they were both out \\nback, keeping an eye on the building power switch so no one could turn it \\noff.  It was less distance to the car, so he just walked out to the car, \\nrummaged around in the back seat and brought back the camera kit.  Jim \\nwaited for him, typing a space every 3 minutes. \\n\\n     \"Take it easy on the polaroid, damn film costs two dollars a shot,\" \\nas he handed the camera kit to technoid #3.  Technoid #2 came over to \\nhelp and started clicking shots of the screen as Jim worked his way \\naround in the directory tree.  There were *lots* of interesting directory \\nand file names.  Stel, Marge, and the three masked visitors from back \\neast had spent a whole evening making up provocative names like HIT_LIST \\n(Lenny\\'s address book), and $LAUNDRY (data for a spreadsheet program \\nMarge used), and a lot of disaster names like HINDENBG, and TEX_CITY.  \\nSince the crypt program left the directories in the clear, they thought \\nthey might as well make them amusing.  At the moment, with cold sweat \\ndripping down his back, Lenny wished he had made the directories a little \\n*less* provocative. \\n\\n     Once in a while, technoid #3 or Jim as Lenny was beginning to use to \\nidentify him--gotta scribble that name on the white board--would give the \\ncommand to type out a file to the screen.  He either got a mess of \\npublished material from decade-old anarchist newsletters, some of which \\nthey carefully photographed on the screen, or computer-generated random \\nbytes (which, of course, they thought was encrypted material).  One or \\nthe other of the technoids not sitting at the screen kept themselves \\nshielding the power switch and plug.  Stel was sitting on the grubby \\ncouch waiting for the technoids to either break into the system or screw \\nup.  Lenny went over and joined her, feeling miserable about the agents \\ngetting in through _his_ system and unwilling to watch any more and give \\naway by body language when they were about to trip.  He glanced at his \\nwatch.  The damn cron program should ask for the password in another 20 \\nminutes.  \"Jeez,\" he thought, \"I hope they don\\'t get anything.\"  \\n\\n     \"There are _10_ copies of something which looks like a word processor \\non the server hard drive--they all have the same byte count and date, and \\nthere is _NO_ \\'path\\' set,\" technoid #3 bitched loudly enough for Lenny to \\nhear.  (Happened that this was an accident.   Lenny had found that if he \\ncopied the word processor into each directory he made, it worked fine.)  \\nThe server had an old 700 Mbyte drive, and a few copies more or less of a half \\nMeg program made no big difference.  However at the moment, the technoids \\nhad concluded that this was a clever hack, that the system would wipe the \\npassword out of memory if they tried to run the wrong word processor \\nprogram.  They outfoxed themselves: any one of them would have worked \\nfine.  (\"Type\" or \"copy\" to the screen wouldn\\'t work because the WD*11.0 \\nstored files in compressed binary.) \\n\\n     \"Well, Bob, it is moment of truth time.  We can take a 1 in 10 \\nchance of starting up the word processor and looking at the files, or we \\ncan try to load in a program to extract the key from this thing\\'s \\nstinking memory.  What say?\" \\n\\n     \"You guys are the experts, don\\'t ask me.\" \\n\\n     After a short conference, technoid #3 fished a diskette out of his \\npocket, kissed it for luck, and stuck it in the drive on Lenny\\'s machine. \\n\\n    \"Here goes nothing.\" and he typed \"dir a:\".  The crypt program was \\nwatching for diskette access, and came back with: \\n\\n                  \"I NEED A PASSWORD! \\n\\n     \"Shit.\"  whispered a dejected technoid under his breath.  \"Know \\nanybody at NSA?\" \\n\\n---------------- \\n   \\n     Lenny put the back of his palmtop on the microphone of a payphone \\nand hit the dial button. \\n\\n     \"That will be one dollar for the first minute.\" \\n\\n     Bong, bong, bong, bong. \\n\\n     \"Thank you for using ESJI, you have one minute.\"  Buzz-click, \\n\\n     \"Hello, there is no one here at the moment, but you can record a \\nmessage.\"\\n\\n     \"Here\" was a little module of code in an automated PBX/voice mail \\nmachine watching for incoming calls after working hours on a line deep in \\nthe list of numbers assigned to a small corporation.  It was an old \\nmachine, and unlikely to get another software upgrade.  After taking a \\ncall, it would not take another for several hours, and it rotated through \\nseveral recorded messages.\\n\\n     Lenny hit the next button down on the palmtop.\\n\\n     #-Beep, 4-Beep, 3-Beep, 6-Beep.\\n\\n     \"confirm with password.\\n  \\n     L-beep, E-beep, N-beep.\\n\\n     \"Record message.  End with any key.\"\\n \\n     Beeeeep. \\n\\n     \"Nancy, its Murray, just called to say hi.  Get back to me sometime \\nwhen you get a chance.\"  #-beep. \\n\\n    \"Message confirmation number 36, repeat 36,\" and a click.\\n         \\n     The PBX made a local call to a paging company and transmitted what \\nlooked like a phone number.  The phone number digits added up to 36.\\n\\n     Lenny punched 36 into his palmtop and hit the enter key.  It came up \\nwith an address, a description, and a phone number.  It was the phone  \\nnext to the K-mart entrance about a mile away. \\n\\n    \"K-mart will be closing about the time I get over there,\" he thought. \\n\"Could have taken the bike.\"  He closed the palmtop.  It sensed the \\nclosing and erased its encryption password. \\n\\n     Lenny got back in his tiny 5 year old \"B-car,\" the 60 mpg car some \\nrich dude had been force to take in a package deal when he bought a 20 \\nmpg Lincoln Towncar.  He twisted the key.  The lights dimmed as the \\ncatalytic convertor came back up to heat on the battery.  There was a few \\nseconds\\' wait to let the battery recover, and the car started.  Lenny \\nwatched for cops as he drove over to the K-mart, but he didn\\'t drive \\n*too* cautiously.  That was one sure way to attract attention.  There \\nwasn\\'t much of a mob leaving the closing K-mart on a weekday.  Lenny \\nparked near the phones and walked over.  He was about 20 feet away when \\nthe one on the left rang.  He picked it up and said, \\n\\n     \"36.\"\\n\\n     \"What\\'s the problem?  If you forgot your key, I can\\'t help.\" \\n\\n     The voice on the other end sounded odd.  It was probably going \\nthrough some blind location in Mexico where the automatic number \\nidentification had not yet been installed.  It also had the quality of \\ndigital speech.  Original words of the speaker were being converted to \\nphonemes and back to words.  Not a hint of the speaker\\'s real voice \\nquality came through, though this dodge did not affect word choice and \\nrhythm patterns. \\n\\n     \"Agents,\" Lenny said.  The CCAs came in early this afternoon.  I \\ndon\\'t think they got anything, but I needed someone to talk to.\" \\n\\n     \"Dumb idea if they are watching you, but tell me what happened \\nanyway.\" \\n\\n     Lenny related the events of the afternoon up to the point where the \\nagents lost the password on his machine by trying to load a memory dump \\nprogram from a diskette.  And then he went on. \\n\\n     \"After that, they popped the cover off the server, hooked up their \\ngear and copied the 700 Meg disk, a few dozen 60Mbyte SMs, and a few \\ndozen 3 meg floppies.  One of them had your crypt package.  They didn\\'t \\nmention my palmtop, and Marge keeps the backup tapes at home.  Only \\ntook them about 2 hours. They put the covers back on and left me with \\nwhat they called a PK encrypted 2.4 Gig WORM cartridge.  They took one \\njust like it, and even made me choose which one I got.  The order said I \\nwas required to take one of them.  It has all kinds of legal seals and \\nsignatures on it.  They said take it to our lawyer.  One of us took it \\nover about 5 pm.  None of us have a way to read it.  Are we in trouble?\"  \\n\\n     There was quite a delay.  Then, the digital voice spoke up. \\n\\n     \"Even if they were able to track me down, *I* am not in trouble. I \\nmake a point of posting all the programs I ever give out.  In source code \\nyet.\" \\n\\n     \"I don\\'t think you are in trouble from what they took with them.  \\nThe copy they left with you is the data off your disk, encrypted with a \\nhalf-key the judge issued.  Until the hearing they can\\'t read it because \\nthey lack the other half of the key. The only use for it is to keep them \\nfrom making a copy of data, changing the data and making another one of \\nthose write-once cartridges.  So, you are ok till the hearing.\"  \\n\\n     There was more delay, then the funny sounding voice on the other end \\nof the line went on. \\n\\n     \"Presuming the passwords are not compromised, even getting the other \\nhalf of the key from the judge to look at what they took should not be a \\nbig problem.  But since they came in at all, I would say you are in big \\ntime trouble.  That was a piece of dumb luck that they didn\\'t try WD* on \\nyour files.  Of course they always have the option to give you blanket \\nimmunity and force the key out of you, but by the time they get around to \\ndoing that, you can forget the key.  I sure would.  I presume you had the \\nmachine convert all the files after they came in to a new password?\" \\n\\n     \"Not yet.  I haven\\'t let anyone put a password into any of the \\nmachines since they showed up.  I\\'m afraid they will have a camera bug \\nlooking over my shoulder.  About a month ago, I read in the paper that \\nthey did that to a bookie in St Paul.\" \\n\\n     \"Not likely for you--but possible.  Hmmm, did they leave any \\njudicial orders about not moving the machines?\" \\n\\n     \"Not from what I read on the court order.  I can ask our lawyer.  \\nOur lawyer may be good at filing objections to logging company projects, \\nbut I think he is out of his depth if they go after us criminally.  I \\ncan\\'t afford a criminal lawyer.  I called around and the best deal I \\ncould get was $100k retainer, cash or gold, no checks.\" \\n\\n    \"They have already gone after you criminally.  You don\\'t get a data \\nsearch order from a judge without a fairly good reason.  On the other \\nhand, it was not a search warrant.  It is arguable that they shouldn\\'t \\nhave gone looking at stuff in your files, but who needs to argue?  They \\neither don\\'t have enough on you for that or they are waiting to see what \\nyou do and who you talk to after the DSO.  I don\\'t know and don\\'t want to \\nknow what you are doing, but there must have been something that tipped \\nthem off.\" \\n\\n     \"I can\\'t think of anything--even if the people we are sending email \\nto on the east coast had all been turned, I can\\'t see how they could have \\ntraced it back to us.  Mail to them was going through about 10 blind \\nlinks, sometimes took 3-4 days to get cross country, it was deep \\'crypted \\nall the way, and somebody donated the digital stamps.\" \\n\\n     \"Never like to use digital stamps I haven\\'t bought myself with cash, \\nand then only from a reputable Swiss bank.  But I can\\'t see how that \\nwould have done any harm . . . . is there any chance the stamps might \\nhave been \\'used?\\'  That would certainly compromise your traffic, though \\nnot the messages.\" \\n\\n     \"Nope, a few of the messages circulate back to us.  They wouldn\\'t if \\nthe \"stamps\" were no good.\"  \\n\\n     \"Not necessarily true.  The mom and pop forwarders often accumulate \\nstamps for a week or more before sending them to the bank.  You just \\ncan\\'t check with a bank on dollar or sub-dollar amounts--connect time \\neats you up. \\n\\n     \"The first link was Telesis, and I know they are on line to the bank \\nthat issued the stamps . . . .  Unless they are . . . . in on it. . . .\" \\nLenny was looking right at the Telesis logo on the phone. \\n\\n     \"Yeah, \\'/Paranoia strikes deep/\\' . . . .  Did the court order say \\nanything about why they were going after you?\" \\n\\n     \"No, there was a note on the order that the supporting affidavits \\nwere sealed.\" \\n\\n     \"You guys rate!  There hasn\\'t been a sealed affidavit for a DSO I \\nknow about in the last ten years.  The stink around the Steve Jackson \\nwarrant took years to wear off!  Well, they have to unseal them before \\nthe hearing.  The hearing has to be within the next three weeks if I \\nremember right.\" \\n\\n     \"You do, it\\'s on the 9th of next month, 20 days from now.\" \\n\\n     \"Well, the first thing you should do is change the password, so you \\ncan start forgetting the old one.  How much clear stuff was on the disk? \\n\\n     \"None that I know about . . . . well actually about half the disk \\nwas filled with the nastiest old published stuff we could find--rabid \\nlibertarian literature and anarchist newsletters, public domain stuff off \\na CD ROM. The rest was filled with random numbers from a noise card when \\nyour guy set it up last year, then we deleted about half of it to give us \\nworking space.  But far as I know, there was nothing to worry about in \\nthe clear.  Snooper hasn\\'t been complaining about unencrypted files when \\nI run it on startup every morning.\" \\n\\n     \"There is a hole in that program, but it takes some very special \\ncircumstances for it to fail.  I kind of doubt you are being watched.  If \\nthey were going to go to that much trouble, a search warrant instead of a \\ndigital search order would have been the way to go, but if you are really \\nworried about them looking over your shoulder, take your machine and the \\nserver to a random motel you\\'ve never been to before.  Lets see, if you \\nhad to do the whole disk, it would take maybe two hours.  You shouldn\\'t \\nlose anything if you have to interrupt the process in the middle--wait, \\nyours is a 3 person office?\" \\n\\n     \"Yes.\" \\n\\n     \"Main password, and then one for each of you?\" \\n\\n     \"Yes.\" \\n\\n     \"Option 4:7 is what you want to use.  It will decrypt only through \\nthe old main password, and reencrypt through the new password.  Data \\nnever comes up to clear.  Try that.\" \\n\\n     \"Ok.  Should I take it off to a motel?\" \\n\\n     \"Suit yourself.  You know how good or bad you have been.  But do \\nkeep me informed.  Hasn\\'t been a case this interesting in years.  Random \\nroute Email by preference, but call if you need to, same method.\" \\n\\n   ------------- \\n\\n     Lenny and Marge checked into a motel which had definitely seen \\nbetter times, but was happy to take cash.  A lot of people had quit using \\ncredit cards, especially for checking into a motel on the hourly plan.  \\nIt was just too easy for people to tap into credit card records.  The \\nswimming pool was dry in July, but what the heck, they weren\\'t here for \\nswimming. \\n\\n     \"I can\\'t believe this, Marge, this power outlet has only _two_ \\nholes.\" \\n\\n     \"Lenny, this place was built before they invented grounding plugs, \\nwhat do you expect.\" \\n\\n     \"Well, what the heck are we going to do now?\" \\n\\n     \"First we look around.  No problem, the socket in the bathroom is a \\n3 pronger.\" \\n\\n     Lenny plugged in the powerstrip while Marge plugged the pieces of \\nthe PCs together and connected a short network cable between them.  Lenny \\njoked to keep down his nervousness; \\n\\n     \"Wonder what they thought of us.\"  Not many couples bring in couple \\nof PCs to do perverted things in the dark.\" \\n\\n     \"Lenny!\" Marge said sharply. \\n\\n     \"No, Marge, I meant the _PCs_ will be doing things in the dark, not \\nus.\"  Marge picked up on the joke by looking disappointed. She really \\nwasn\\'t.  Lenny was one of those rare guys who just did not care about sex \\nwith anybody.  Her regular boyfriends knew she was not getting any at \\nwork. \\n\\n-------------- \\n\\n     The \\'crypt program rejected the first three passwords Lenny tried as \\ntoo simple.  Which to him meant easy to remember.  He finally got it to \\naccept anhtre spelled a@n7t%h7e$r (the password program would drop the \\nfinal r).  Lenny\\'s first password had been sesame.  He had used \\nvariations on opendoor, opendore, openwindow, enterhere, portculius, \\ndrawbridge, safedoor, gateway at various times.  If anybody had a list of \\nhis passwords, they would be a long way up on selecting attacks.  He felt \\nhe was doing the best he could to make them complex, but still \\nrememberable.  He left the duress password (bugout) alone.  It was one he \\nhad kept using for years, and never had needed.  Lenny wasn\\'t certain he \\nwould use it if he got a chance.  Even though Marge backed up the disk \\nevery week, he would lose a lot of work if he used the duress password \\nand wiped the disk. \\n\\n----------- \\n   \\n     They crammed the computers back into the tiny car five hours later.   \\nMarge dropped the key in the slot by the office and they drove back to \\nthe GreenRage office where Marge and Lenny set up the machines and Marge \\nstarted the backup program.  The CCA observer made voice and printed \\nnotes of their return on his palmtop from the stakeout location inside a \\nfurniture company office about a block down the street. \\n\\n--------- \\n\\n     The office never got up to full productivity over the next five \\nweeks, but Lenny did finish and email the project--with notes to the \\neffect that the enclosed was chapters from a book he was writing, and a \\ntrue-to-life description of the data search order being carried out.  He \\nleft it up to the folks on the other end.  If they wanted to carry out a \\nproject which was in the hands of the cops, it was on their heads. \\n\\n---------- \\n\\n     The DSO hearing went about as expected.  The judge granted a two \\nweek extension over the protest of Bruce, the GreenRage\\'s lawyer.  When \\nthe day came, Lenny, Marge, Stel, and Bruce were all looking more \\nrespectable than they usually did.  Even Stel was wearing a dress (long \\nout of style, but the only decent one she owned).  \\n\\n     The hearing at the federal building started in open court with a \\nrequest from the US Attorney for the judge to review the CCS\\'s material \\nin camera.  \\n\\n     \"Mr. Mulronny, I have already looked over the affidavits you sent \\nover, and I can\\'t do it.  I already granted you an extra two weeks, and \\nthe law can only be stretched so far.  You either have to make a case and \\nlet these people defend their data, or you have to drop it.\" \\n\\n     Mulronny looked unhappy, but was prepared with the unsealed \\naffidavits.  He gave one to Lenny, one to Bruce, and one to the judge.  \\nThe judge looked at Bruce, \\n\\n     \"Your honor, this is only about 11 pages, I think my client and I \\ncan review it during a short recess, or you could take up other actions \\nwhile we review this.\" \\n\\n     Court matters were running a little ahead of schedule that morning, \\nso the judge had the clerk pencil them in after the next two short \\nactions.  They went out in the hall, not worrying about snoops except \\nbeing overheard.  The last time a judge found out that someone was \\nbugging the courthouse, the head of the agency that did it spent time in \\nthe drunk tank for contempt. \\n\\n     Lenny had read the affidavit almost through when they reached the \\nfar end of the hall.  Bruce waited till he finished, and said,  \\n\\n     \"Well?\" \\n\\n     Lenny shook his head, \\n\\n     \"They\\'re after someone else.  I\\'ve read about some of the events \\nthey are citing, but I sure don\\'t know anything about them.\" \\n  \\n     That wasn`t entirely true.  One of the \"events\" was one Lenny had \\nput together, but when it didn\\'t come off within a year, he had decided \\nthey had chickened out.  Since the project he had put together took out \\nmuch of an oil refinery, he was not surprised.  Industrial sabotage on \\nthat scale took more than a little guts.  When the plant finally blew up, \\nLenny watched the papers for weeks, but never found out if it was ruled \\naccidental.  The feds did not seem to be sure either, they only mentioned \\nit as a possibility.  The other accusations were split between cases \\nwhere Lenny strongly suspected sister organization had done the deed, or \\nindustrial accidents where some organization had taken credit for what \\nwas probably an accident. \\n\\n     Back in court Bruce complained to the judge that there was nothing \\nsubstantial in the affidavit supporting the DSO, and that while his \\nclient did not have anything to hide, the government was asking to break \\ninto the confidential business records of a public interest group.  And \\nif they would not just forget the whole thing, he wanted more time to \\nrespond.\\n\\n     The US Attorney would have asked for more time to respond if Bruce \\nhad not, so he was agreeable.  The clerk set a date for 6 weeks off.\\n                                                  \\n--------\\n\\n     Lenny was paralyzed from the neck down.  The judge was asking him \\nfor the password, and he could not remember it.  The bailiff, clerk, \\nBruce and Mulroony were all talking in a huddle and he could not make \\nsense out of anything they said, no matter how hard he tried.  \\n\\n    \"This will do it!\" one of them said, and jammed a furry dead fish \\nunder his nose. \\n\\n    Lenny found he could move as he pushed it away.  He woke up to find \\nthe cat had been licking his face and smelling of fish flavored cat food. \\n                                \\n    5:14 AM.  \"There isn\\'t much point in trying to get back to sleep,\" he \\nthought but Lenny flopped back on the bed.  The cat started to purr and \\nkneed the covers.  Lenny absently rubbed its head, and thought about the \\nnext fundraising letter.  The DSO had had the effect of galvanizing the \\nGreenRage membership, so donations were way up, and for the first time in \\nseveral years, there was more than just a little money in the bank \\naccount of GreenRage.  Of course, it was flowing out almost as fast.  \\nEven though Bruce charged about half the going lawyer rate to public \\ninterest organiztions, fighting the DSO was going to cost them a bundle.  \\n\"Just how much of the stuff on the disk is going to cause trouble,\"  \\nLenny realized he had spoken outloud.  If they asked for a special \\nmaster, the membership list could be declared off limits.  Unlike the old \\ndays, when the cops could look through outgoing mail at the post office, \\nan electronic mail list was fairly secure.  \\n\\n     There wasn\\'t much of interest in the finantial records either.  Oh, \\na few thousands spent for sabatage material would be hard to account for \\nif they really dug into it, but the bulk of the money was spent on \\nsaleries, office supplies, rent, and telecom charges.  They could always \\nclaim the money was spent on spray cans and ceramic spikes for trees.  \\nAnd we can say we spent it for dope.  Lenny grinned at this one.  He had \\ngiven up smoking dope, made him too paranoid.  But, every fall some \\nunknown but appreciated benifactor sent the office a plastic tub of the \\nstickyest buds you could imagine. Perhaps one of their above ground \\nefforts had saved some trees screening the \"crop.\"   Marge and Stel had \\nsplit the tub the last two years. \\n\\n   The problem was not the lastest project.  Nor was it the one or two a \\nmonth Lenny had put together over the last 3 years.  They were long \\nperged, and the disk space overwritten.  And he didn\\'t worry about the \\ncontents of the newletters.  Presumably *somebody* on the list was a \\nringer, and the cops had a collection of *The GreenFlag.*  What woke \\nLenny up in the middle of the night (besides his cat) was the stuff which \\nthey had on that WORM disk which *had not yet happened*.  He could \\nprobably get away with claiming that the files on the events which had \\nhappened were interactive fiction based on news stories.  Or could he?  \\nNope, the damn files are dated prior to the \"events,\" he thought.  And, \\neven though fewer than half of the projects he had worked on ever came \\noff, there were at least three or four of them they could nail me on.  \\n\\n   Lenny turned the light on and pulled his palmtop out of the charging \\nstand next to the bed.  He stretched the keyboard out to full size and \\nset there trying to put his thoughts in order.  After entering his \\npassword, he brought up an organizer program.  It prompted:  State the \\nproblem. \\n\\n    \"I don\\'t want to go to jail for conspiricy.  The only way to stay out \\nof jail is to keep the cops from looking through the GreenRage computer \\nfiles.  Or is it?   If they can\\'t convence the judge that they need to \\nlook through the files, then no problem.  If they can, then they come \\nasking me for the password.  Assuming they can\\'t crack the encryption-- \\nwhich seems likely.  If I give it, I go to jail, if I don\\'t, I may get \\njailed for contempt, unless they give me blanket immunity.  In either \\ncase, my days of managing monkey wrench projects are over.\" \\n\\n    The organizer program came up with: \\n\\n    You have used one or more legal terms.  We recommend you submit your \\ncompleted outline to a lawyer. \\n\\n    It then proceeded to break the statements into an if-then-else logic \\ntree which did not help Lenny much either. \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Tom.Jennings@f111.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Tom Jennings)\\nDate: Thu, 15 Oct 92 02:10:13 PDT\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: re: Game items...\\nMessage-ID: <2962.2ADD350B@fidogate.FIDONET.ORG>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nScrew this fake scenario shit, here\\'s some real ones:\\n\\n-- Safe sex in the age of AIDS.

I also\\nuse the nome de\\' plume \"The Mentor\" when traversing the computer underground.\\n\\nOn to stuff relevant to the list:\\n\\nA group of us here in Austin have spent a great deal of time discussing\\nthe advantages of RSA-encrypted e-mail. I\\'m putting a BBS back up later\\nin the year, and would like to offer secure communications to my users.\\nSince the threat of seizure is very real (the feds still have over $10,000\\n(1989 street price) of computer equipment of mine since I\\'m \"still under\\ninvestigation\"), this needs to be implemented before the message is ever\\nwritten to hard disk.\\n\\nTo implement this, I\\'m currently trying to get PGP up on my Amiga, then\\nwrite the necessary C & AREXX functions to link it in with my BBS\\'s (DLG\\nPro) email function.\\n\\nThe outgrowth of this was the Keystone project. We\\'re going to attempt to\\nget everyone in Austin cyberspace public-key capable, and get a master\\nkeyring that will be regularly distributed via a trusted system to other\\nnodes in town. Ideally, you would be able to send RSA-encrypted email from\\nany bbs on any of the local nets to any other bbs -- even if all you know\\nis the destination address. We\\'re going to do this by attempting to make\\nthe bbs PGP-friendly. All the user has to do is generate a key pair.\\n\\nThe two potential weak links in this chain are line security and key\\nvalidation. The first is almost insurmountable -- unless the user takes the\\ntime to d/l a complete copy of PGP and the Austin Keystone Keyring and\\nencrypt the mail on their home system. But if not, then they have to live\\nwith the chance that someone is data-tapping. The second will rely on\\nface-to-face identification -- this is why we\\'re making this a local effort.\\n\\nIt will probably be Christmas (when I have a 3-week vacation) before serious\\nstrides are made in this, but I\\'m interested in any comments people may\\nhave.\\n\\nLoyd\\n\\np.s.

Both systems do provide privacy, no mistake.\\n\\nI would be hesitant to implement a system that _only_ required a user\\nto generate a key pair.

Moving around a\\ncomplete directory does not scale well.\\n\\nAs far as BBS support, if I want to respond to someone and I don\\'t\\nhave the corresponding key, I should be able to initiate a zmodem\\ntransfer of that key relatively easily, for instance without leaving\\nthe discussion area to go to a download area.\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: George A.

The big\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----\\n\\nat the start pretty much gives that away.\\n\\nIn most cases, this is fine, but sometimes it may not be desirable\\nto make it this obvious.  Sending encrypted messages may call\\nunwelcome attention to yourself.  Also, some people are experimenting\\nwith packet radio on the amateur bands, and it\\'s not legal to send\\nencrypted messages there.\\n\\nWhat I think would be nice would be an \"innocent\" mode for PGP\\nin which it created files which looked like something else.  For\\nexample, what if your encrypted output file looked like:\\n\\nbegin 666 testpat.gif\\nMI\\\\44:#G4D>QQXR!-M,Z20O1K&5D<U\"C;V<J#-I@:ANT,A+>0, 5-4F.X<%MT\\nM2:V94,K;XE@B?]%IHF+_<VT=U! 3Q;;M-K<QT.N\"?%IJTNU!%(KF7K]2^B6+\\nM;&TTGTULW(4%:F@\\\\&MB^ ^Y5Y\\\\#2A6^*86F-Y\"^%J$>WGI%(]#=F]/[LV+&!\\nM,NH0(!3B35CW#!-Z7\"B_L\\'=-C 8DLB-(J R\"3?EE9<.>QE4Y?T$66IA7B@W?\\nend\\n\\nThis will be recognizable, if you\\'ve seen many, as a uuencoded file,\\na common encoding for non-ascii files.  The header line suggests\\nthat it is a graphics file.  Tons of these types of files are sent\\nacross email networks every day.  Sending your encrypted messages\\nin this form would give you a lower profile.\\n\\nStill, if someone goes to the effort to uudecode your message,\\nand examines the resulting file, it will be obvious that it\\'s not\\na GIF file because it lacks the proper headers.  Instead, with\\nthe current PGP implementation it will be obvious that it is in\\nfact a PGP file, because the header format matches the PGP spec.\\n\\nAgain, I think it would be better if PGP in this mode were able to\\nproduce a file without headers which will give away what it is.  Even\\nbetter would be the ability to mimic headers of some other types\\nof files, such as the .ZIP, .ZOO, or Unix \"compress\" format which are\\noften used in binary files people mail around.\\n\\nAnother thing that I think is kind of bad about PGP in the context\\nof avoiding traffic analysis is that it puts the key ID of the\\ndestination person in the header.  There was some discussion during\\ndevelopment of a mode in which no key ID information would be in the\\nheader; the only way you\\'d have of knowing if the message was for\\nyou was to try decrypting it.  (There is a checksum which is used\\ninternally to tell if the decryption was done with the right key.)\\nThis way you could broadcast messages to some group, and no one could\\nknow which person in the group you were sending to.\\n\\nThese \"anonymous destination\" messages could be encoded with a key\\nID of zeros, and the PGP software could easily be modified to let\\nthe user try a decryption on such a message, reporting success or\\nfailure.\\n\\nHow useful do these kinds of features seem to people?

That would seem to be a variation on the old\\ntheme of the book cipher, which is *not* random and therefore *not* secure.\\nAlso, agreeing on key procedures over the *phone* in *clear voice* is kind\\nof like sex without a condom.  Not secure.  Not safe.  Potentially deadly.\\n\\nWhile we\\'re on the subject of link encryption, the same response pertains to\\nthe suggestion made by someone from SJG here (whose name I ought to know but\\nmy memory for names has more holes than Bush\\'s economic plan) about key\\ndistribution and transmission of cleartext over phone lines.  It *doesn\\'t\\nmatter* if it\\'s encrypted at the BBS server, if it goes in clear over the\\nphone.  Keyword in context recognition is no problem when dealing with\\nASCII.  Various agencies (you know who) have raised this to a fine art.  The\\ntelephone line is precisely the link in the chain which is weakest and needs\\nmost to be protected.  If the nasty-wasties break down your door and go for\\nyour hard drive, it\\'s already too late.  Like worrying about a condom after\\nthe fact.  \\n\\nNow as a matter of record, \\nit\\'s been demonstrated that a processor emits electromagnetic radiation back\\nover the phone lines as well as electrical power lines, which can be picked\\nup at a distance.  So consider for a moment that there is a BBS serving\\ndissidents, who Big Brother wants to monitor.  Seeing all the encrypted\\ntraffic, they install a device on the phone line and the AC to pick up what\\nthe mircoprocessor is doing.  And they see it doing crypto, and they see the\\ncleartext which is recovered, and get the keys, and the whole damn thing may\\nas well be transparent.  So for BBSs and such, I would argue that it\\'s\\nnecessary to have electromechanical relays to isolate the computer from the\\nphone lines when encrypting or decrypting; ideally isolate it from the AC as\\nwell (using an uninterruptable power supply, which will run the computer on\\nbatteries for some period of time, say 45 minutes).  So you have a great big\\nred toggle switch next to the computer, and for some period during the day\\nwhen doing all the crypto processing, throw the switch to the Safe position\\nto get it off the phones and AC lines.  This might make BBS use a little\\nless convenient (in that email becomes available the day after it was\\nposted), but at least it\\'s not literally leaking everyone\\'s secrets into the\\nairwaves.  \\n\\nThis general area is part of a larger topic called TEMPEST.

Consider someone asking you about your\\nencrypted mail to be an opportunity to start a conversation about\\ntheir position on personal privacy.  When your sysadmin asks why your\\nmail can\\'t be read, tell him you are defending your privacy and ask if\\nthere is any problem with that.  Then, when the sysadmin puts in a\\nfilter for PGP traffic, use innocent mode.\\n\\n>Another thing that I think is kind of bad about PGP in the context\\n>of avoiding traffic analysis is that it puts the key ID of the\\n>destination person in the header.  \\n\\nAbsolutely.  Ditto for signatures.  Both should be able to be\\nselectively removed.  In any case, it should be possible to have\\nnothing appear on the outer envelope.\\n\\nAnother feature for PGP would be automatic message padding.  To\\nproperly do a mix you need to quantize the message lengths.  If PGP\\nwere to automatically pad with random data, it would save a lot of\\nintegration work for the mix.

There is some trade\\npublication devoted entirely to such matters; it\\'s called EMI/RFI\\nNews, or Interference Protection News, or something like that.  It\\'s\\nfree to qualified subscribers.  The articles are interesting, but\\ncannot delve into the really interesting stuff.  But the ads!  Look at\\nwhat people are selling, and remember that it is protecting against\\nsomething.  Stuff like copper impregnated gasket material, both for\\ncomputer cases and for doors (in walls).  Copper braid and cloth.\\nConductive glues and caulks.  Special connectors.  Electrical\\nisolators.  Fiber optics.\\n\\n(Aside: If you don\\'t know how to be a qualified subscriber, you\\'re no\\nhacker.  Look closely at the subscription card and then figure out\\nwhere the publisher of a free magazine gets its money.)\\n\\nWhat is possible?  CRT monitoring.  A Dutch guy named van Eyck\\ndemostrated six years ago or so a CRT monitoring system which he built\\nout of spare parts.  It consisted of an TV roof antenna, a non-detent\\nUHF tuner (which you can make yourself by removing the detent plate\\nfrom an old TV), and a multi-scanning monitor.  No amplification\\nbeyond what was in the tuner, no sync stabilization, no special\\ndirectional antennas or any other tricks.  He was able to reliably\\npick up monitor emissions from 100 meters, if I remember correctly.\\nFancier equipment knows what your screen sync rate is, uses bandpass\\nfilters, uses better antennas, knows to look for mostly-persistent\\nframe information, looks for emissions signatures, and is able to read\\none CRT out of a hundred at half a mile.  I suspect this is a low\\nestimate of the ability of modern equipment.\\n\\nHal mentions using flat panel displays to combat emissions.  This\\nworks, as evidenced by the continued existence of Grid Computer.\\nRemember Grid, who came out with these way-expensive gas plasma\\nlaptops around 1985/6?  The reason they sold so many of those and are\\nstill around was that a large number of them were Tempest certified.\\n(Even larger revenues!)  I understand that the Tempest spec Grids had\\na thin layer of gold foil in front of the screen, even so.  Yes, gold\\nthin enough to see through.\\n\\nSignal wire monitoring.  Using twisted pair or coax cable, reduces\\ntransmitted energy down to very low levels, improving energy transfer\\nand reducing monitorability.  But even with zero radiated energy there\\nis still the near field of the wire which can be inductively tapped.\\nNo conductive contact is necessary.  If you can put a wire next to my\\nphone line somewhere, you can tap my phone.  It\\'s by nature a high\\nimpedance tap, requring sensitive ampilifiers but at the same time\\ndifficult to find even by a reflectometer.\\n\\nWithout a twisted pair, the situation is worse.  Keyboards for the PC\\nuse a serial protocol at a fixed frequency.  The cables are not\\ntwisted pair.  I haven\\'t heard anything about that specifically, but I\\npresume that keystrokes can be read extremely easily.\\n\\nCPU monitoring.  Yes, it\\'s possible.  I\\'ve heard that it is possible\\nto actually run a CPU in parallel with a monitored one.  In order to\\ndo this, you need to correlate signals in real time across a fairly\\nwide RF spectrum.  Each CPU pin or I/O bus signal occurs in a\\ndifferent physical location inside the case.  The case is active in\\nterms of emmission, reflecting signals around like mad.  All these\\ndifferent physical locations and reflections give rise to phase\\ndifferences and interference patterns.  Once you figure out what the\\nsignatures of the various signals are, you can separate them out from\\neach other by correlation and deconvolution.  George\\'s concern about\\nemissions through phone lines falls into this category.\\n\\nOther stuff.  I\\'ve heard rumors about using microwave pinging to\\ndetermine stuff about electrical equipment.  Or about implanting\\npassive devices that alter the EM field locally in order to make\\nmonitoring easier.  It\\'s safe to presume that there is some amazing\\nstuff going on.  Read The Puzzle Palace for more hints.  (Like the\\nvalley in WV which is one big antenna.)\\n\\nEmissions monitoring is also all economics.  The price to monitor\\nincreases with each more sophisticated attack.  CRT\\'s are easy, CPU\\'s\\nare hard.  I would like to see public research in this area, just like\\nthere is public research in cryptography.  Until the public has a\\nbetter idea of what various attacks cost, there can\\'t be rational\\ndecisions about emissions security.\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hollander <hh@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Tue, 20 Oct 92 11:40:12 PDT\\nTo: nobody@soda.berkeley.edu\\nSubject: Re: Tempest.\\nIn-Reply-To: <9210201452.AA01970@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMessage-ID: <9210201839.AA08315@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nLike I said, just carry everything (keys and software) on your laptop.

Della\\n               (1:125/180 or marcos@zippy.sonoma.edu)\\n\\n\\nDef:  De.pos.i.to.ry (di-POZ-i-tohr-ee) n. a storehouse, a place for\\nsafekeeping of things\\n\\n-+---------------------------------------------------------------------+-\\n\\nWith the latest release of the PGP20 program, public key availability\\nhas fallen into the hands of the individual.  This provides a relative\\ndegree of security over messages that are sent from user to user in\\nvarious formats (text, binary, etc) over different transportation\\nmechanisms.  I will not go into the system that allows public keys to\\nwork nor public key history.  Instead I\\'ll point you to the rather\\ncomplete documentation that comes with the PGP program.\\n\\nUnfortunately, there is a major drawback to this system (also pointed\\nout in the PGP documentation).  Public key distribution has few\\nsecurity elements involved to insure the validity of a particular key.\\nPGP attempts to address this problem by providing a \"signature\" system\\nto each public key to give reasonable validity to its origin.\\nUnfortunately, this depends upon trust of the individual who signs the\\nkey to begin with.  Who polices the policemen?\\n\\nUnfortunatly, the issue of key validity is yet another topic that\\ncannot be easily addressed since authenticity lies in one persons\\ntrust of another.  Yet there still needs to be a system in which keys\\ncan be distributed or held for later use.  This system should be\\nmultiply redundant and have some degree of immediate access in order\\nto make the information stored useful.  One such system would be a\\ndepository, a place to store public keys for later retrieval.\\n\\nThis proposal will attempt to describe a system whereby you can get\\naround the validation of public keys problem without requiring someone\\nto police the Depository itself!\\n\\n--------\\n\\nProblems Involved:\\n\\n - How do you know the key depositor isn\\'t faking his/her keys?\\n\\n - How do you verify (at the depository) that a key being deposited is\\n   from the key originator or is even valid?\\n\\n - What is to prevent the depository from faking keys that is \"signs\"?\\n\\n - How can this system be resonably redundant and easy to access?\\n\\nFirst off, the depository is NOT a validation center.  The system\\nnever will verify the users as existing or if they are even honest\\nusers.  The depository key signature only verifies that the key has\\nbeen deposited and is available for access at any time.  Again, the\\ndepository DOES NOT verify users, only the fact that a deposit has\\nbeen made.  (A better form of deposit slip)\\n\\nIf a user wants to deposit his/her key, what is to prevent the sysop\\nfrom intercepting this public key, making a substitution replacement,\\nand then forwarding the new public key?  Unfortunately, there are\\nsysops out there that have already done this in some respects.\\nThereby the system has to place the responsibility upon the user for\\nkey deposit verification.  To prevent the sysop from changing the\\ndeposit, the user should use the Depository Public Key (hereafter\\nreferred to as DepoKey) to send his/her key for deposit.\\n\\nAgain, what prevents the \"bad\" sysop from just throwing this message\\naway (obviously he can\\'t read it) and sending a fake message (also\\nencrypted with the DepoKey)?  Although this eventually thwarts the\\nentire system (the sysop cannot fake the users public key unless the\\nuser uploads it in plain text to the sysop), it still causes problems.\\nTo prevent this, the user should include some sort of text in the\\ndeposit that the depository will mail back to the user, ENCRYPTED\\nalong with the user\\'s public key.  When the user receives a valid\\nmessage back that contains his original text, things are fine.  If the\\nuser does not receive a response in a few days or gets an incorrect\\nreturn message, then the user should send a cancel message to the\\ndepository and re-deposit his or her key.  The complete the handshake,\\nthe user should send an authentication back to the depository stating\\nthat the key was recieved correctly (instructions on how to do this\\nshould be returned with the key). If a return reciept isn\\'t back in a\\nresonable period of time, the depository will remove the key from its\\ndeposit keyring.  NOTE:  This will never invalidate a public key, it\\nwill only prevent it from being distributed via the depository system.\\n\\nWhat is to prevent the depository from faking keys that it \"signs\"?\\nWell, in order to be effective with fake keys, you need to be in the\\ntransport path of the messages that you are planning on \"stealing\".\\nSince the depository is not a major hub or node (except possibly to a\\nfew people) this negates any effect of faking keys.  Also, once a user\\nhas received verification that the depository has his public key, he can\\nthen also post it anywhere.  The depository will return his public key\\nwith a depository signature on it.  This allows the user to upload a\\nverified key to anywhere.  When keys are distributed with a depository\\nsignature on them, then they are on file with the depository in case\\nsomeone wants to withdraw them later.\\n\\nAs long as the public key for the depository is made worldwide public,\\nthis system will work.\\n\\nAs for creating a multiply redundant system, there should be several\\nsites that are listed as depositories.  These systems will on a weekly\\nbasis, exchange acknowledged keys (ie, keys that have undergone the\\nhandshaking process) with one another.  A user can then request a key\\nfrom ANY of the depository sites and get the same information.\\n\\nFor those that want certified keys (other than from the users) such as a\\nBBS system needing the public key of another, there will be a withdrawal\\nmechanism built into the depository to pull single or multiple keys.\\nAlso, the complete public keyring may optionally be pulled (FREQing).\\n\\n-----------\\n\\nThe actual mechanism:\\n\\nBelow is the Depository Public Key.  Any public key that has been signed\\nwith this depository key will be assumed to have undergone the handshake\\nprocess to verify that the originator of the key pair has in fact issued\\na valid key.  This signature only verifies the deposit (a reciept).\\n\\n*** THIS KEY DOES NOT VERIFY THE IDENTITY OF THE USER!!!  ONLY THAT ***\\n***      THE USER WAS IN FACT THE ORIGINATOR OF THE PUBLIC KEY      ***\\n***      AND HAS DEPOSITED IT INTO THE PUBLIC KEY DEPOSITORY!!!     ***\\n\\nFor user identification, there should be a second or third signature\\nfrom a BBS or known friend.  This will give the key a verification\\nlevel.  If the user wishes to deposit a key with another person\\'s\\nsignature, there will be no problem since the handshake method still\\ninsures the source and destination of the message.  (Note:  This is\\npreferred since depository keys will then be distributed with dual\\nsignatures)\\n\\nThe depository allow four functions:  Deposit, Withdrawal, Cancel, and\\nAcknowledgement of Deposit.  To use these function...\\n\\nDEPOSIT:  Address a message to \"Depository\" at one of the listed\\ndepositories at the end of this document.  The subject will be \"Deposit\"\\nand the text body will contain your Public Key (in Ascii format) and\\nsome small body of text that will be reflected back to you.  NOTE:  The small\\nbody of text and your public key should be encoded WITH the Depository Key.\\n\\nWITHDRAWAL:  Address a message to \"Depository\".  The subject will be\\n\"Withdrawal\" and the text body will contain what you are looking for on\\neach line just as if you were polling your own PGP program.  You will be\\nsent back a list of keys with the depository signature verifying the\\nmessage.  Note that a * for the body text will give a LONG list back to\\nyou...  For fidonet, this MIGHT require a poll to recieve your return list.\\nSee Appendix A\\n\\nCANCEL:  Address a message to \"Depository\".  The subject will be\\n\"Cancel\" and the text body will contain the text \"CANCEL PUBLIC KEY\"\\nwith your signature on the message.  The cancel will not take place\\nwithout your signature!  You will receive a cleartext response to this.\\nAll this does is to remove your public key from the depository keyring.  If\\nthis comes with a \"kill\" signature for the key, then it will be moved from\\nthe deposit keyring to the invalid/killed keyring.\\n\\nACKNOWLEDGE:  Address a message to \"Depository\".  The subject will be\\n\"Acknowledge\" and the text body will contain the text \"ACKNOWLEDGE\" with\\nyour signature on the message.  Without the signature, your public key\\nwill continue the daily countdown to keyring removal.  A cleartext message\\nwill be returned upon any receipt of this message.\\n\\nAnything that doesn\\'t fit one of these will be rejected and a return\\nmessage will be bounced back.\\n\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n                          *** WARNING ***\\n\\nThis proposal ONLY provides a method of storing keys for public\\ndistribution and withdrawl.

Until the public has a\\n> better idea of what various attacks cost, there can\\'t be rational\\n> decisions about emissions security.\\n\\nI think the longterm solution to this problem is the same as that for\\nthe key problem: small, highly portable, self-contained computers for\\ndoing the most sensitive work and for providing passwords to remote\\nsystems. Smartcards are one approach, though they obviously are highly\\nconstrained in what they can do other than act as ATM or VISA cards.\\n\\n(Laptops are one idea. Following Eric\\'s suggestion that we look into\\nTEMPEST issues, perhaps we could \"rate\" different laptops and PCs for\\nemissions. Just a thought.)\\n\\nApple\\'s \"Newton\" PDA (\"Personal Digital Assistant\"), General Magic\\'s\\nwhatever (talk to Fen L., who works there, but who won\\'t say much),\\nEo\\'s Hobbit-based PDA, and other systems (Sharp, Casio, etc.), offer a\\nbetter platform, at least for the long term. With 100 MIPS\\nperformance, LCD screens, and no dangling keyboards and cables, these\\ngizmos should be favorably positioned for security-conscious\\napplications. RF emissions should be low to begin with (and can be\\ncharacterized, of course); additional shielding should be easier to\\nachieve than with full-sized units.\\n\\nPDAs also are small enough that people will carry them everywhere,\\nthus both enhancing security against tampering, and also making them\\nworkhorses for security applications. With a good interface to desktop\\nmachines, the critical security functions can be done inside the PDA\\n(e.g., accessing a terminal or remote system using zero knowledge\\nprotocols, where the PDA answers a challenge question without\\nrevealing the actual password or whatever secret key). The announced\\nPDAs also have slots for \"PCMCIA\" cards, small credit-card-sized cards\\nthat can add functionality and memory.\\n\\nThe lack of a keyboard in the smallest of these units will be a limit\\n(though external keyboards are options...and with some care, these\\nkeyboards can even be made TEMPEST class, though leakage will still\\npersist. A battery-operated keyboard with fiber-optic link to the PDA\\nmight be one approach.). \\n\\nThe issue of hooking these PDAs to desktop machines and networks is an\\ninterestesting one. Wirless links would seem to be risky, except that\\nif all critical computations are done _inside_ the PDA then what gets\\ntransmitted is not really \"fragile\" (in the eavesdropping sense). I\\nsuspect that someone will offer a small fiber optic link (like the one\\nI have going between my CD player and my DAT machine).\\n\\nAnd it will be a couple of years before these become common. But it\\'s\\nabout 2-3 years from now that our mission gets really interesting,\\nanyway. Digital money, anonymous voting and conferences (imagine using\\nwireless, encrypted links in meetings to negotiate without opponents\\nknowing..just one of several small business product niches), and all\\nkind of other crypto anarchy ideas.\\n\\nPGP 3.0 for PDAs!\\n\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

This same protocol can also be used over an\\nordinary modem connection between a user\\'s PC and a BBS, preventing\\neavesdropping or wiretapping of that phone call.  It would also be\\nable to protect phone calls between a PC and a Unix timesharing system,\\nregardless of what networks lie in between, if we wrote a simple login\\nprogram that handled the modem protocol.  (It doesn\\'t protect against\\nactive re-routing of the call, e.g. by substituting another machine\\nfor the BBS, but we could work on that as Phase II.)\\n\\n(I suggest that the initial Diffie-Hellman handshake all be done in\\nASCII encoding, no matter what the medium, so that the same protocol\\ncan be used on all media, binary-transparent or not.)\\n\\nThis scheme would require support in the BBS and in the user\\'s PC\\nterminal program.

I passed over it before\\nbecause I was more interested in the social issue, but the technical\\none is important.\\n\\nThe basic technique is the foundation of cryptography: information\\ntheory.  For this application, you can just measure the entropy; it\\nalone should be able to distinguish between the three sources.  The\\nentropy measures how well one can statistically predict the output of\\na source.  A random source has eight bits of entropy per byte.  As\\nrandomness decreases, so does the entropy measure.  (Mail me if you\\nwant references in order to learn this stuff yourself.)\\n\\nNow line noise, let\\'s say, will appear random.  So its entropy should\\nbe right near the maximum, 8 bits.

Although \\nunderlying technologies may change, the applications and \\npractices developed now are shaping the universal broadband \\ninfrastructure of the future.  \\n\\nHowever, concern for copyright protection remains a major \\nimpediment to private investment in information resources and \\nservices.  Owners of information resources are fearful of \\nreleasing proprietary information to an environment which appears \\nlacking in security and has no accepted means of accounting for \\nuse and copying.  Complex library systems may be designed and \\ndeveloped around nonproprietary information, but until there are \\nmechanisms to accommodate proprietary information, the utility of \\nthe systems will remain limited by the nature of the material \\nmade available.  \\n\\nInformation technology enables the vision of a distributed, \\ninteroperating multimedia environment in which information from a \\nuniverse of different sources can be combined and recombined to \\nmeet specific user needs.  Ironically, the vision is threatened \\nby the absence of systematic controls.  \\n\\nMindful of this problem, Congress directed that the National \\nResearch and Education Network (the follow-on to the federally \\nfunded portion of the Internet) -- \\n \\n     (1) be developed and deployed with the computer, \\n     telecommunications, and information industries....\\n\\n     (5) be designed and operated so as to ensure the \\n     continued application of laws that provide network and \\n     information resources security measures, including \\n     those that protect copyright and other intellectual \\n     property rights....\\n\\n     (6) have accounting mechanisms which allow users or \\n     groups of users to be charged for their usage of \\n     copyrighted materials available over the Network.... \\n     [15 USC 5512(c)]\\n\\nThe Act also requires the Director of the Office of Science and \\nTechnology Policy to report to Congress by the anniversary of the \\nAct (i.e., December 9, 1992) on \"how to protect the copyrights of \\nmaterial distributed over the Network....\" [15 USC 5512(g)(5)]\\n\\nDespite this statutory language, federal agencies have yet to \\naddress these issues.  Many believe that the protection of \\nintellectual property on the NREN as on any network is a private \\nsector problem which needs to be addressed at an applications \\nlevel, not within the design of the network.  Indeed, these \\nintellectual property problems are not new; to a large extent, \\nthey represent traditional copyright problems which have been \\nexacerbated by electronic technology, digitization of \\ninformation, personal computers, and less advanced forms of \\nnetworking.  But the prospect of pervasive, high-bandwidth, \\ninterconnected wide-area networks presents the problems in the \\nmost complete context.\\n\\nThere is a tension between the goals of protection, on the one \\nhand, and interoperation and usability, on the other, that has \\ndefeated technological solutions in the past.  ADAPSO\\'s proposed \\nhardware lock failed to gain industry acceptance, and software \\ncopy protection has been abandoned except in certain high-value \\nniche markets.  The microcomputer software industry has come to \\nrely on the threat of lawsuits in the vulnerable corporate \\nenvironment as a means of copyright enforcement.  Nonetheless, a \\nhardware-secured environment incorporating serial copy management \\nhas been mandated (as an amendment to the Copyright Act) for the \\nnext generation of digital audio technology.\\n\\nIn the emerging environment, the conventional distinction between \\nproducts and services breaks down.  Products are networked, and \\nnetwork-accessible services are linked to products.  Rights must \\nbe acquired to cover all forms of delivery, because multiple \\ndelivery paths are likely and the dominant technologies and \\nmarkets cannot be predicted with confidence.  On the other hand, \\nthe control and security offered by different technologies may \\nalso determine the choice of distribution paths.  For these \\nreasons, the workshop will look at the networked multimedia \\nenvironment as a whole, from mass-market products to specialized \\nservices.\\n\\n\\n                                                                           \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tribble@xanadu.com (E.

Such\\nknowledge did not come from the communications because they were\\nencrypted.  If the provider could read them, then they weren\\'t\\nencrypted to the provider.  Therefore such knowledge came from some\\nother source.  A claim that arises from such knowledge is not met by\\nthis criterion.\\n\\nThe defense of encrypted communications is not a blanket defense.\\n\\n>Suppose the provider has keys to the encrypted communications?\\n\\nThen the defense does not apply.  If the provider has keys to the\\ncommunications, then they are not encrypted as far as the provider is\\nconcerned.  The question is not the _form_ of the communications, but\\ntheir _legibility_.\\n\\n>Suppose those keys are only to be used under duress (e.g. under a\\n>court order)?\\n\\nIf the keys are in the possession of the provider and the provider and\\nthe user have an agreement that the provider is not to use them in any\\nway other than archiving them, then the law cannot expect the provider\\nto routinely breach that agreement to search for possibly illegal\\ncontent.  The court may then subpoena these keys if necessary.\\n\\n>Suppose the provider is a parent and the user is their teenage\\n>daughter?\\n\\nThe defense of encrypted communications is not germane here.  There is\\na parent/child relation which creates a claim which the encrypted\\ncommunication defense is irrelevant to.\\n\\n>Suppose the encryption is easily breakable?\\n\\nThe test of due diligence may be applied.  If the state of the art is\\nthat the encryption is unbreakable, then the communications should be\\nconsider to be encrypted.  If the cipher is automatically crackable,\\nsuch as monoalphabetic substitution, then the communications should be\\nconsider _not_ encrypted.

If you can\\'t\\nread the content, then _a fortiori_ you can\\'t control it either.

Accordingly, for many years, one of the \\nmost important tools in the investigation of crime for Federal and \\nState criminal law enforcement agencies has been the court authorized \\ninterception of communications.  As illustrated below, the majority of \\noriginal authorizations to intercept wire or electronic communications \\nare conducted by State criminal law enforcement agencies. \\n\\n   Interception Applications Authorized\\n      State  Federal  Total \\n1984    512    289    801 \\n1985    541    243    784 \\n1986    504    250    754 \\n1987    437    236    673 \\n1988    445    293    738 \\n1989    453    310    763 \\n1990    548    324    872 \\nTotal  3440   1945   5385\\n\\n   Approximately, 3/8 of authorized interceptions were conducted by \\nFederal agencies, while 5/8 of the authorized interceptions were \\nconducted by State criminal law enforcement agencies.1 \\n    The recent and continuing advances in telecommunications \\ntechnology, and the introduction of new technologies by the \\ntelecommunications industry, have made it increasingly difficult for \\ngovernment agencies to implement lawful orders or authorizations to \\nintercept wire and electronic communications, as well as to implement \\npen register and trap-and-trace court orders or authorizations.  These \\nnew technologies inadvertently undermine the ability of criminal law \\nenforcement agencies to enforce effectively the criminal laws and \\nprotect the national security.  Without the assistance and cooperation \\nof the telecommunications industry, these new technologies will impede \\nthe ability of the telecommunications industry, these new technologies \\nwill impede the ability of the government to enforce the criminal law. \\nAccordingly, the purpose of this bill is to clarify the existing \\nresponsibilities of electronic communication services providers and \\nprivate branch exchange operators, as established, for example, in 18 \\nU.S.C. ____ 2518(4), 3124(A), (B), to provide such assistance as \\nnecessary to ensure the ability of government agencies to implement  \\nlawful orders or authorizations to intercept communications. \\n    Over the past twenty-five years, the working relationship between \\nthe criminal law enforcement community, particularly the Federal Bureau \\nof Investigation as the federal government\\'s primary criminal law \\nenforcement agency, and the telecommunications industry, in response to \\nthe appropriate court orders or authorizations, has provided government \\nagencies with timely access to the signals containing the content of \\ncommunications covered by the court orders or authorizations.  As a \\ngeneral proposition, this has involved providing the means to acquire \\nthe communication as it occurs between two individual telephone users \\nat a remote location, not dissimilar to a call in which the two \\noriginating parties do not know that a third party is listening, and in \\nwhich the third party (the criminal law enforcement agency) records the \\nauthorized and relevant calls. \\n    Historically, and with relatively few exceptions, the \\ntelecommunications industry has provided the criminal law enforcement \\ncommunity with the ability to monitor and record calls:\\n\\n   1.  at the same time asthe call is transmitted to  the recipient;\\n\\n   2.  in the same form as the content of the call was transmitted \\nthrough the network, notwithstanding the use by the target of custom  \\nfeatures of the network; \\n\\n   3.  whether stationary or mobile;\\n\\n   4.  at the government monitoring facility; \\n\\n   5.  without detection by the target or other subscribers; and \\nwithout degrading any subscriber\\'s service.\\n\\n    However, the introduction of new technology has begun to erode the \\nability of the government to fully effectuate interceptions, pen \\nregisters and trap-and-race court orders or authorizations that are \\ncritical to detecting and prosecuting criminals.  As technology has \\ndeveloped, the telecommunications industry has not always ensured the \\ncontinued ability to provide the same services to the criminal law \\nenforcement community.  The telecommunications industry\\'s introduction \\nof certain types of new technology poses real problems for effective \\ncriminal law enforcement.  Legislation is necessary to ensure that the \\ngovernment will be provided with this capability and capacity in the \\nfuture by all providers and operators and to maintain a level playing \\nfield among competitive providers and operators in the \\ntelecommunications industry.\\n\\n   There have been instances in which court orders authorizing the \\ninterception of communications have not been fulfilled because of \\ntechnical limitations within particular telecommunications networks.  \\nFor example, as early as 1986, limited capabilities became apparent in \\nat least one network which will only be corrected later in 1992.  This \\ntechnical deficiency in a new technology forced criminal law \\nenforcement agencies to prioritize certain interceptions to the \\nexclusion of other court orders. Accordingly, for approximately six \\nyears, there have been court orders that have not been sought by the \\ncriminal law enforcement community or executed by the \\ntelecommunications industry and, as a consequence, important criminal \\ninvestigations have not been brought to fruition or have been less than \\nefficiently concluded.  This is one classic example of new technology \\naffecting adversely the criminal law enforcement community:  a \\nmicrocosm of what may be expected on a nationwide basis without \\nenactment of this legislation. \\n     Section 1 of the bill states Congressional findings and purpose. \\n     Section 2 is divided into seven subsections..  Subsection (a) \\nestablishes as a matter of law the responsibility of electronic \\ncommunication services providers and private branch exchange operators \\nto continue to provide, within the United States, the capability and \\ncapacity for criminal law enforcement agencies to intercept wire and \\nelectronic communications when authorized by law.  These subsections \\ndelineate the existing attributes of wire or electronic communication \\ninterception. \\n    1. Concurrent with Transmission.  The application for a court order \\nto intercept telecommunications conversations or data transmissions is \\nrarely a leisurely process.  For example, on the Federal side, the \\ndevelopment of the required affidavits, submission to the Criminal \\nDivision of the Department of Justice for approval, transmission of \\napproval to the Assistant United States Attorney, the appearance of the \\nAssistant before a judge to request the order and the delivery of the \\njudge\\'s order to the appropriate telecommunications company is \\nfrequently completed in a very short time.  However, crime waits for no \\none and the system for approval of interceptions must and does conform \\nwith the realities of the activity that is sought to be investigated \\nand, if appropriate, prosecuted as criminal offenses.  Since time is of \\nthe essence, current law requires that service providers and operators \\nprovide the government forthwith all information, facilities and \\ntechnical assistance necessary to accomplish its mission.  It is \\ncritical that the telecommunications industry respond quickly to \\nexecute the court order or authorization.  The ultimate problem of \\ntimeliness, however, is the real-time monitoring of the intercepted \\ncommunications.  As serious and potentially life- threatening criminal \\nconduct is detected, it may be necessary to move quickly to protect \\ninnocent victims from that conduct.  Accordingly, \"real-time\" \\nmonitoring is critical. \\n     2. Isolated Signal and Services Used. Nearly all of the  \\ncommunications network is partially \"analog\" at this time.  In \\nconducting an interception, for example, of a telephone conversation, \\nthe government is allowed to monitor and record criminal conversation \\nsuch as a conspiracy, minimizing the acquisition of non-criminal or \\ninnocent conversation.  When an electronic communication services \\nprovider or private branch exchange operator introduces a new \\ntechnology--such as a digital signal--the communications are converted \\ninto a different and more efficient form for transmission, but a more \\ndifficult form to monitor during interception.  The bill requires only \\nthat the provider or operator isolate and provide access to the \\nelectronic signal that represents the content of the communications of \\nthe target of the intercept2  from the stream of electronic signals \\nrepresenting other communications.  This provision seeks to ensure \\nthat, in the new electronic environment in which signals are mixed for \\ntransmission and separated at another switch for distribution, the \\ngovernment does not receive the communications of any individual other \\nthan the individuals using the target\\'s communications point of origin \\nand receipt;  the government must remain subject to the minimization \\nstandards of 18 U.S.C. __  2518(5). \\n     This provision also makes it clear that an electronic \\ncommunication services provider or private branch exchange operator is \\nnot required to provide for reconversion of the isolated communication \\nto analog or other form.  The government expects that this process will \\nbe accomplished by the government. \\n     3. Mobility and Features.  Increasingly, criminal acts are being \\nconducted or discussed over cellular telephones or by using special \\ntelecommunications features.  As this mobility is introduced, the \\nelectronic communication services providers and private branch exchange \\noperators would be required to assure the capability and capacity for \\ncriminal law enforcement agencies to continue lawful interception. \\n     Further, this subsection makes it clear that features used by the \\ntarget do not defeat the court order or authorization.  For example, \\ncommunications which have been addressed to the telephone number of the \\ntarget, but which may have been programmed through a call-forwarding \\nfeature to another, otherwise innocent, telephone number, must be \\ncaptured and made available to criminal law enforcement authorities \\npursuant to court order or authorization.  This requirement will \\nobviate the need for applications for authority to monitor otherwise \\ninnocent telephone numbers that receive, only intermittently, calls \\nforwarded by the target.  The effect of this provision is to further \\nminimize monitoring of calls of innocent parties.  Similarly, certain \\nspeed dialing features that mask the telephone number called by the \\ntarget must be identified for criminal law enforcement investigation.  \\nThe ability to consistently determine the destination of calls is \\ncritical to minimizing the monitoring of innocent calls. \\n     4. Government Monitoring Facility. Government agencies do not \\nnormally request the use of telecommunications industry physical \\nfacilities to conduct authorized interceptions nor is it encourage by \\nthe industry.  Normally, the government leases a line from the \\nelectronic communication services provider\\'s or private branch exchange \\noperator\\'s switch to another location owned or operated by the \\ngovernment.  This minimizes the cost and intrusiveness of \\ninterceptions, which benefits the service provider or operator, as well \\nas the government.  Accordingly, the ability to monitor intercepted \\ncommunications remotely is critical. \\n     5. Without Detection.  One of the reasons that governments operate \\ntheir own facilities is to reduce the risk of detection of the \\ninterception, which would render the interception worthless.  At the \\npresent time, the existence of an interception is unknown to any \\nsubscriber and is not detectable by the target, notwithstanding \\nfolklore and spy novels.  This provision merely ensures that the \\nsecrecy of effective interceptions will be maintained. \\n     6. Without Degradation.  Maintaining  the quality of the telephone \\nnetwork is in the interest of the government, the industry and the \\npublic.  Presently, the existence of an interception has no effect on \\nthe quality of the service provided by any network to the target or any \\nsubscriber.  This provision ensures that the quality of the network \\nwill continue to be uncompromised.  Absent the assistance delineated by \\nthis legislation, the execution of court orders and authorizations by \\nthe government could well disrupt service of the newer technological \\nsystems, a result that this legislation seeks to avoid. \\n     Subsection (b) provides that electronic communication services \\nproviders and private branch exchange operators with the \"public \\nswitched network\" must be in compliance with the minimum intercept \\nattributes within eighteen months after enactment.  Thereafter, new \\ntechnologies must continue to meet these minimum attributes. \\n     Subsection (c) provides that electronic communication service \\nproviders and private branch exchange operators that are not within the \\n\"public switched network\" must be in compliance with the minimum \\nintercept attributes within eighteen months after enactment. \\nThereafter, new technologies must continue to meet these minimum \\nattributes. \\n     Subsection (d) provides that the Attorney General may grant \\nexceptions to the affirmative requirements of subsection (a), as well \\nas the implementation deadlines of subsections (b) and (c).  In \\nconsidering any request for exception, the Attorney General will \\nconsult with Federal Communications Commission, the Small Business \\nAdministration and the Department of Commerce, as appropriate.  \\nAccordingly, the Attorney General has the authority to except, for \\nexample, whole classes, categories or types of private branch exchange \\noperators where no serious criminal law enforcement problems are likely \\nto arise, such as hospital telephone systems. \\n     This subsection also permits the Attorney General to waive the \\nrequirements of subsections (a), (b) and (c) on application by an \\nelectronic communication services provider or private branch exchange \\noperator. Accordingly, if a particular company can not comply with one \\nor more of the requirements of subsection (a), or needs time additional \\nto that permitted under subsections (b) or (c), the Attorney General \\nmay grant an appropriate waiver. \\n     Subsection (e) provides that the Attorney General has exclusive \\nauthority to enforce the provisions of the bill.  While a number of \\nStates have authority to seek and execute interception orders, they \\nwill be required to seek the assistance of the Attorney General if \\nenforcement of this legislation is required.  This section also \\nprovides for injunctive relief from violations of the provisions of the \\nbill. \\n     Subsection (f) provides for enforcement of the provisions of the \\nbill through imposition of civil fines against any company that is not \\nexcepted from the provisions of the bill, does not acquire a waiver of \\nthe provisions of the bill, and fails to meet the requirements of \\nsubsection (a) after the effective dates set out in subsection (b) or \\n(c), as appropriate.  A fine of up to $10,000 per day for each day in \\nviolation may be levied;  for most companies in the telecommunications \\nindustry this amount is sufficient to ensure that compliance will be \\nforthcoming.  Although this provision is not expected to be used, it is \\ncritical to ensure that compliance with the provisions of the bill will \\noccur after the effective dates of the requirements of subsection (a). \\n     Subsection (g) carries forward a number of definitions from the \\ncurrent provisions for the interception of wire or electronic \\ncommunications under \"Title III.\"  The definition of \"government\" that \\nis currently in use includes all States, territories and possessions of \\nthe United States, as well as the United States, is made applicable to \\nthe bill.\\n\\n   [Footnotes]  1Interceptions for foreign intelligence and \\ncounterintelligence purposes are not counted within the figures used \\nhere, but would likewise benefit from enactment of the legislation.\\n\\n   2 Whether the content is voice, facsimile, imagery (e.g. video), \\ncomputer data, signalling information, or other forms of communication, \\ndoes not matter; all forms of communication are intercepted. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: fen@netcom.com (Fen Labalme)\\nDate: Sat, 24 Oct 92 13:24:14 PDT\\nTo: jjaloszyns@bluejay.mich.fred.org\\nSubject: Re: fbi-wiretap-bill (& ftp.eff.org)\\nMessage-ID: <9210242023.AA15395@netcom.netcom.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n>> Speaking of that stupid FBI phone legislation, do you know where I can\\n>> obtain an exact copy of the bill?

A\\npaper envelope sealed with water-soluble glue is just fine. It stops\\ncasual snoops, like the lock on your car door does. None of which will\\nstop a determined thief, but like Eric says, it\\'s economics -- this\\nlevel of security is inexpensive as hell.\\n\\nTwo: it gets people introduced to the very basic concept that there\\n*is* privacy (security) available, and possible. In the FidoNet, and\\nthe BBS world, this is important.\\n\\nThree: In FidoNet, we\\'ve got 16,000 sysops, doubling every 18 months,\\nworldwide. Traditional key systems are not only wildly impractical,\\nthey\\'re unnecessary for traditional reasons -- who much security to I\\nneed to talk to someone 5,000 miles away I\\'ve never met?\\n\\nFour: If I need *real* security, I will (or better!) obtain keys in\\n\"traditional\", secure ways. I can plug these keys into my casual\\nprivacy system, which will hopefully encompass the technological\\nmechanisms of en/decryption, signing, plaintext handling, and all the\\nassorted baggage we\\'ll have to drag around anyways.\\n\\nFive: it will entrench some disasters; bum, or faked keys, humongous\\nduplicates, inexperienced people forgetting their secret pass phrases\\nso they can\\'t even issue key-removal certificates (this has happened\\nalready; its a MAJOR pain in the ass), one \"person\" with a zillion\\nIDs, inconsistent IDing, etc etc etc etc etc.\\n\\nOh well. \\n\\nIn fact, no system gets implemented right.

See the\\nrecent RISKS articles in comp.risks (esp. 13.86). \\n\\nSince RISKS is copyrighted, and we wouldn\\'t to do anything to make the\\nlawscums unhappy, I\\'ll summarize:\\n\\n* Denning proposes that anyone using public key encryption over public\\nnetworks be required to register their private keys with, for example,\\nthe Justice Department.\\n* To avoid the risks of someone else getting the key, she suggests the\\nprivate keys could be encrypted with the _public key_ of Justice, and\\nthen held by an independent agency. (Ostensibly, the encryption and\\nregistration could be done by the user himself, though some means of\\nverifying compliance would have to be devised.)\\n* To make use of the private key (for example, to read e-mail\\nencrypted with the key), the government would have to get a court\\norder, present it to the independent agency, take the key back to\\nJustice, decrypt it with the private key of Justice, and then proceed\\nwith their surveillance and whatnot.\\n\\nThis is ostensibly like the procedure for wiretapping.\\n\\nHowever, it would screw up the use of encryption in many ways.\\nRegistering a key would precluded frequent key changes, would probably\\ncost some fee (on the order of $50, like a driver\\'s license, I\\'d\\nguess), and would of course greatly complicate the use of digital\\npseudonyms and all the other neat stuff we\\'ve talked about (but which\\ncaution tells me not to discuss here on an open and unsecured\\nlist...you can check my .sig to see where I stand, of course).\\n\\nMy hunch is that Denning and the other \"quaint\" (cf. Sterling\\'s \"The\\nHacker Crackdown\" for a description of how the crypto bigwigs interact\\nwith hackers at CFP and elsewhere) cryptheads have alerted the\\ngovernment to the _real_ threat of cryto tools.

Errors would\\noccur at random intervals, depending on which bits got hit. Getting\\n1000 errors a second would be tough, though, as such high intensities\\nwould also tend to eventually destroy the chip (through longterm\\ndamage to the silicon, threshold voltage shifts, etc.). If you really\\nwant to pursue this seriously, I can help with the calculations, etc.\\n\\n: Details:\\n: \\n: Certainly in high volume these things can be made cheaply. Smoke detectors\\n: often sell for under $10, and have a radioactive source, an IC, a case, etc.\\n\\nYes, but smoke detectors use ionization in a chamber (the smoke from a\\nfire makes ionization easier). That is, no real ICs. But ICs, and even\\nRAM chips, are cheap, so your $10 figure is almost certainly in the ballpark.\\n\\nA bigger concern is safety, or the _perceived_ safety. Smoke detectors\\nhave, I understand, moved away from alpha particle-based detectors to\\nphotoelectric detectors (smoke obscures beam of light). Don\\'t\\nunderestimate the public\\'s fear of radioactivity, even at low levels.\\n\\n: Using a well-designed circuit based on Alpha decay should mean that the\\n: randomness is pretty darn good.\\n\\nBut not necessarily any better than noise from a Zener. With the\\nhigher bit rate from diode noise, more statistical tricks can be done.\\nThe relatively low bit rate from alpha decay gives less flexibility.\\nOn the other hand, alpha hits are undeniably quite random, with\\nessentially no way to skew the odds  (unlike with diode noise).\\n\\n: Everyone these days has either a serial or parallel port available, either\\n: directly or thru a switch box.\\n: \\n: The tiny \"dongle\" size is a convenience. If it is small and powered directly\\n: from the port, there are no cables to get in the way. There is enough power\\n: available from the signal lines on these ports to power simple devices. E.g.\\n: most mice don\\'t require an external power supply.\\n: \\n: For most applications 1000 bits per second should be adequate. For example,\\n: it would be quite adequate for session keys. For generating pseudo\\n: one-time-pads, an overnight run should generate plenty of values. Continuously\\n: generating values for a month would produce about 300 MB, which should be\\n: enough to exchange new CD-ROM key disks once a month.\\n\\nOne time pads are complicated to use. Only very high security\\napplications that can also afford them use them. For example, some\\ndiplomatic traffic. I can\\'t conceive of a case where 300 MB a month\\ncould be used. \\n\\nAnd _theft_ (or copying) of the CD-ROM one time pads has got to be a\\nmuch bigger issue that whether alpha particle noise sources are better\\nthan diode noise sources! By about 10 orders of magnitude I would say.\\n\\nBlack bag jobs on the sites holding the keys will be the likeliest\\nattack, not trying to analyze how random the noise is (even a fairly\\ncrummy noise source will not yield enough information to a\\ncryptanalyst trying to break a one-time pad).\\n\\nHaving said all this, I\\'m glad you gave some thought to alphas.

Discussion of this is in comp.risks (\"RISKS\"), so far, but\\ncertainly belongs in this group.\\n\\nI posted a summary of this position to a private mailing list devoted\\nto crypto issues and got a huge response of concerned folks. I don\\'t\\nunderstand why this is not a hot topic on sci.crypt, so I\\'ll post\\nsomething right now.\\n\\nHere\\'s my understanding of her proposal:\\n\\n* Anyone using public key cryptography would be required to register\\nthe private key with the appropriate authorities, for example, the\\nJustice Department.\\n\\n* To head off the obvious concerns about the government routinely\\nreading e-mail, financial dealings, etc., this registered key would be\\nstored at an independent agency after first being encrypted with the\\n_public key_ of Justice. (That is, the independent key storage agency\\nwould have an unusable key, so _they_ couldn\\'t use it themselves.)\\n\\n* To obtain a usable form of the private key, Justice would have to\\nget a valid court order, go to the independent storage agency, present\\nthe order, pick up the key, open it with their own _private key_, and\\nproceed to open mail, read communications, etc.\\n\\nThis is ostensibly the procedure now used for wiretaps.\\n\\nBut the effect on encryption would be chilling:\\n\\n-would greatly complicate the rapid changing of keys\\n\\n-would probably be a way to get \"unlicensed\" crypto programs off the\\nmarket (e.g., don\\'t think about using PGP 2.0, as the key registration\\nauthorities would either insist on another algorithm, or would send\\nthe \"registration application\" to, for example, RSA Data Security for\\nlegal action)\\n\\n-would undoubtedly require a \"fee\" (like a driver\\'s license)\\n\\n-would interfere with the use of digital pseudonyms, anonymous nets (a\\nla Chaum\\'s \"DC Net\" proposal, which some of us are exploring now), and\\ndigital money\\n\\n-would establish the precedent that private communications are not\\nlegal, that copies of all private communications must be placed in\\nescrow with the government\\n\\nRegistering keys is no different than, for example, requiring a permit\\nfor every public utterance or for registering typewriters, modems,\\ncomputers, fax machines, and copiers. Or banning the use of sealed\\nenvelopes for mail. In Phil Zimmerman\\'s great words, it would be like\\nrequiring all mail to be sent on postcards.\\n\\nMy suspicion, which Prof. Denning will presumably comment on if she\\'s\\nreading this, is that the government folks have come to understand the\\nprofound implications of modern crypto and are looking for approaches\\nto head off the coming sea changes.

He was mostly criticizing the proposed\\ngovernment Digital Signature Standard, stating that he thought that\\nthe NSA was purposely trying to get \"weak\" cryptography installed as\\nthe standard.  Then he goes on to say,\\n\\n\"Are there technical alternatives that would satisfy all parties?\\nPerhaps.  It is certainly the case that the formulation of the problem\\nto be solved has never been made explicit for the cryptographic\\ncommunity to work on.  I suspect that a solution based on \\'escrowed\\nsecret keys\\' might be workable, wherein each user is legally required\\nto depost his or her secret key with a trusted third party, such as\\nthe user\\'s bank.  Cryptographic hardware and software would only\\noperate with public keys that were certified to having their corres-\\nponding secret keys appropriately escrowed.  A federal agency could\\nthen obtain the secret key, or its use, with an appropriate warrant.\\nOnce their secret keys were escrowed, multinational corporations could\\neven operate across borders with a high degree of authentication and\\nprivacy (except perhaps from court-ordered wiretaps).  Cryptographic\\nhardware and software manufactured in the U.S. would not operate\\nabroad without public keys suitably certified as having their secret\\ncounterparts escrowed in the U.S.  In an extension of this approach,\\nusers can escrow their secret keys with several trusted third parties\\nin a \\'secret-sharing\\' manner, so that no single third party can com-\\npromise the user\\'s key.  While this approach may have its own difficulties,\\nit does illustrate that weak cryptography is not the only technical\\napproach available.  There may be much better techniques for achieving\\na compromise between a number of conflicting national concerns.\"\\n\\nAt the time that I read this, I thought it was largely a rhetorical\\ndevice, making the point that if the government wants to infringe on\\npeople\\'s privacy, it should come out in the open and do so, rather\\nthan skulking about.

I of course agreed....our correspondence is\\nattached below. Sorry if I left off your name in my comments to Glenn\\n...it seems sometimes that nearly everyone I know has some interest in\\ncrypology, privacy, cyberspace, AND is going to Hackers! For those not\\ngoing to Hackers this year, I\\'d still like your inputs, and I\\'ll write\\nup some kind of update after it\\'s over, so you\\'ll get some feedback on\\nyour ideas.\\n\\nThis growing interest in cryptology and the protection of\\nprivacy--fanned by the availability of PGP 2.0, the books and articles\\non hackers and crackdowns by the Feds, the activities of the EFF and\\nCPSR, and by our very own \"Cypherpunks\" crypto group--should make for\\nan extremely interesting time at Hackers this year.\\n\\nJust about every year at Hackers there\\'s a de facto theme. One year it\\nwas hypertext (and Xanadu got started when John Walker of Autodesk met\\nTed Nelson, Mark Miller, Roger Gregory, and others at Hackers in\\n1987), another year it was multimedia. Last year it was effectively\\nthe EFF, and so on. My hunch is that this year the de facto theme\\n_could_ turn out to be crypto tools and digital protection of privacy.\\n\\nIn addition to our session, there will be discussions of wireless\\ncommunication, the work of the EFF, and a Sunday discussion of these\\ncritical issues. These will all fit nicely with our own session.\\n\\nOur session is in \"prime time,\" mid-Saturday afternoon, tentatively\\n(you all know how schedules change!), and is one of the \"no\\ncompetitors\" tracks, so attendance should be very high. Accordingly,\\nsome premium should be placed on organization, to maximize the\\ninformation flow. Too many people for the \"circle discussion\" that\\nworked so well at last year\\'s nanotechnology session (run by Ted\\nKaehler), so we need to figure out a good format.\\n\\nSo give me your inputs! (Also, I think we should get togther\\ninformally Friday to bounce ideas around, the better to make the\\nsession on Saturday richer and more exciting. I\\'ll let you know in the\\nnext several days what we decide, and where we\\'ll meet.)\\n\\n\\n* What topics need to be discussed the most? \\n\\n* What format? Panel discussion? A series of mini-lectures on the\\nvarious topics? Free-for-all discussion? (Remember that we\\'ll probably\\nbe in a big room, with perhaps as many as 100-150 attendees.)\\n\\n* Some ideas for topics (which I\\'ll add to as people make\\nsuggestions):\\n\\n- A very brief review of modern cryptology (very brief because we need\\nto move on quickly to the juicy stuff), including snapshot summaries\\nof encryption, RSA (but no number theory!), anonymous mail, digital\\ncash, etc. (Too many crypto panels spend the entire time bringing\\npeople up to speed on what prime numbers are, on how one-time pads are\\nused, and so on. I favor giving people a good glimpse of the\\n\"exciting\" stuff--anonymous mail, digital pseudonyms, information\\nmarkets, dining cryptographers protocols, etc.--and then letting them\\ngo back and fill in the background. Give \\'em a glimpse of the Promised\\nLand.) \\n\\n- The uses of digital remailers to protect privacy, and progress on\\nbuilding them (a brief summary)\\n\\n- Possible summary of the \"Crypto Anarchy Game\" we\\'ve been\\nexperimenting with here in our Cypherpunks group (Note: we could\\ndescribe it briefly and then invite folks to play it later that\\nevening, perhaps around midnight)\\n\\n- PGP 2.0...what it is, how to get it, and how to use it\\n\\n- Proposed legislation for trapdoors in telephone equipment, and the\\npossibility that crypto keys may be placed under strict controls (a la\\nmy recent post on Dorothy Denning\\'s latest trial balloon)\\n\\n- What we can do about these trends, what we as hackers can do to\\nprotect our privacy. Things like: deploying encrypted e-mail as\\nquickly as possible, using digital pseuodonyms, deploying \"mixes,\"\\narguing for basic constitutional protections, etc.\\n\\n\\nIdeally, people will get so worked up and excited that the rest of the\\nConference will be buzzing about these issues!\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s Glenn\\'s message to me and my acceptance:\\n\\n> > Considering your keen interest in cryptography, I was\\n> > wondering if you could have your arm twisted to help\\n> > pull together the crypto session for the conference?\\n> > \\n> > It should be fairly easy...

They can be used to\\nimplement Chaum\\'s DC-nets.  For the degenerate case of just two people\\ncommunicating, the DC-net is similar to using a one-time pad.\\nHowever, what you are hiding is not _what_ you are sending, but _who_\\nis sending it.\\n\\nDC-nets (\"DC\" stands for \"Dining Cryptographers\", the example Chaum\\nused to introduce the idea) are designed to hide message sources among\\nsome group of people.  The people have to be fairly well connected,\\nwith near-real-time communications capability.  It won\\'t really work\\nfor people exchanging email.\\n\\nFor the simple two-person case, suppose as in the case of the one-time\\npad that each person has an identical CD-ROM filled with random bits.\\nWhat they do is, at some predetermined rate, each person just\\ntransmits the bits off his pad.  Both people are sending the same\\nbits.\\n\\nWhen one wants to send a message, he starts toggling certain of his\\nbits.  To send a \"1\" he sends the opposite of the next bit from the\\none-time pad; to send a zero he sends the correct version of the next\\nbit from the one-time pad.\\n\\nAssuming they don\\'t start transmitting at the same time, what an\\noutside observer will see is that, where before they were both\\nproducing exactly the same bits, now they are producing a certain\\nnumber of opposite bits.  Interpreting each opposite bit as a 1, and\\neach case of same bits as a 0, produces a recognizable message.\\n\\nBut, the outside observer can\\'t tell which person is sending that\\nmessage.  All he sees is two totally random streams of bits, which\\ndisagree at certain spots.  Without access to the one-time pads, there\\nis no way for him to tell who is sending.  (Of course, the two people\\ninvolved know who is sending, since one of them is and one of them\\nisn\\'t.)\\n\\nGeneralizing to larger numbers of people, you need to have a separate\\none-time pad shared with each other person in the group.  In other\\nwords, for a group of N people there has to be a total of N(N-1)/2\\none-time pads; each person has N-1 of them.  That is, for each pair of\\npeople in the group, there is a unique and secret one-time pad which\\nthey share.  (This is for maximal security - you can get by with fewer\\npads if you trust each other some.)\\n\\nNow, they all send all the time.  What they send is the \"XOR\" of the\\nnext bits of all their N-1 one-time pads.  It turns out that if you\\nthen \"XOR\" everybody\\'s output bits, you\\'ll get nothing but zeros as a\\nresult.  When someone wants to send, he sends the opposite of what he\\nnormally would for a \"1\", and he sends just what he normally would for\\na \"0\".  Collisions can be handled like ethernet - back off and\\nretransmit.  (Chaum had another way involving reserving future blocks\\nof transmit time.)\\n\\nWith N people sharing N-1 one-time pads per person, nobody can tell\\nwho is transmitting.  All anyone knows is whether he himself is\\ntransmitting or not; all an outside observer knows is that someone in\\nthe group is transmitting.\\n\\nDC-Nets eat up one-time pads even worse than using them for message\\nsecrecy does.  But, with CD\\'s, you can put a lot of data on a pad.\\nAnd the system is fairly robust against pads being stolen.  If one\\nperson\\'s one-time pads are all secretly copied by a spy, then he can\\ntell if that person is sending.  But he learns absolutely nothing\\nabout which other people are sending.\\n\\nI wonder if it would be possible to experiment with a DC-Net system in\\nthe Internet environment.  I recently acquired an account on a system\\nwith Internet connectivity (I know because I can telnet and ftp from\\nit).  I\\'ve done considerable programming with Unix socket\\ncommunication in systems connected by ethernet, and I think the\\nInternet provides a very similar programming interface.  It shouldn\\'t\\nbe that hard to create a very simple \"chat\" program in which message\\nsources are strictly anonymous (assuming the existance of the required\\none-time pad random-number files - for testing, they could be created\\nby random number generators at each end, started with identical seeds).\\nI\\'ll try some experiments along these lines over the next few days.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: pmetzger@shearson.com (Perry E.

Naturally, such invasions of privacy will only be\\npermitted \"when a warrant is produced\". It has been suggested that\\nthis idea might be taken up by several government agencies for\\n\"review\".\\n\\nMany have noted that the dawning of cheap and effective cryptographic\\nsystems could spell the end of the ability of governments to invade\\npeople\\'s privacy. Unfortunately, it appears that the government and\\nits cronies have also realized this, and intend to take preemptive\\naction. Our notion of civil rights has decayed so far that it is now\\nconsidered a citizen\\'s duty to not merely be quiet while he is\\nenslaved but to actively cooperate with his own enslavement. Not\\nmerely must we put up with the indignity of the government being\\ngranted the right to read our papers and communications to each other,\\nnot merely has the FBI attempted to get legislation passed to make\\nphone companies give them easier access to tap phone lines under color\\nof \"maintaining the current capability in the presense of new\\ntechnology\", but now it is suggested that we ordinary citizens must\\npersonally cooperate to make it easier for them to read our\\ncommunications. We will be branded criminals if we fail to cooperate,\\npresuming that ideas like this are enacted.\\n\\nIt is crucial that the fiends proposing this be convinced that\\nresistance will be too high to implement their plan. It is crucial\\nthat before they can even propose legislation that the threat here be\\nbrought to the attention of the news media. If the currently proposed\\nFBI legislation were passed, a dictatorial government would have all\\nthe tools it would need to tap all the phones in the country -- the\\nonly thing restraining that behavior would be a system of warrants\\nthat could disappear with a mere change in attitude. If Denning\\'s more\\nserious and sinister idea were proposed for future enactment as\\nlegislation (this has not yet been proposed), it would become\\nimpossible for individuals to take any action to protect their own\\ncommunications privacy from a dictatorial regime, even ignoring the\\nquestion of abuses that could occur right now. I\\'m convinced that the\\nonly thing that prevented the FBI bill from passing this year was the\\nfact that media attention was brought to bear. Its important that this\\nnew proposal be exposed to similar sunshine. Far be it for me to\\nsuggest restraint of free speech, but I would like to see people\\nthink of making such suggestions as having the social acceptability of\\ncalling a black person \"nigger\".\\n\\nHere, for reference, is a copy of an article Dr. Denning just posted\\nto sci.crypt on usenet.\\n\\nI encourage people, rather than discussing this matter on libernet or\\nextropians, to discuss this on sci.crypt where the topic is just\\nbreaking.\\n\\nPerry Metzger\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nArticle 6275 of sci.crypt:\\nPath: shearson.com!uunet!uunet!think.com!sdd.hp.com!zaphod.mps.ohio-state.edu!darwin.sura.net!guvax.acc.georgetown.edu!denning\\nFrom: denning@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu\\nNewsgroups: sci.crypt\\nSubject: Re: A Trial Balloon on Registered Keys\\nMessage-ID: <1992Oct27.143737.1574@guvax.acc.georgetown.edu>\\nDate: 27 Oct 92 14:37:37 -0500\\nDistribution: world\\nOrganization: Georgetown University\\nLines: 94\\n\\nThe posting about the proposal I made at the NCSC for key registration\\nis essentially correct.  Let me add to it the following:\\n\\n1.  The government is not taking any action to curb crypto and is \\nunlikely to take any such action in the near future.  No proposal has\\nbeen made and no government agency that I am aware of has plans to\\nmake such a proposal. The closest we\\'ve had to a proposal was a \"Sense\\nof Congress\" resolution in Senate Bill 266 over a year ago.  This \\nwould not have mandated anything, but said it was the sense of \\nCongress that service providers should provide accesss to the \\nplaintext of encrypted communications under a court order.  It got a lot of \\nopposition and was withdrawn.  Thus, don\\'t panic folks -- this was just me\\nmaking a suggestion.  I didn\\'t realize I had that much clout to cause\\nsuch a stir and call to arms!  I expect that the next step will be government \\nsponsored discussions about crypto policy, probably sponsored by NIST,\\nat the recommendation of the Computer System Security Advisory Board\\nheaded by Willis Ware.  That will provide a forum to work through these \\nissues.  \\n\\n2.  The reason I made the proposal is because I am concerned that we\\nmay be facing a major crisis in law enforcement.  I expect many of\\nyou will say \"that\\'s wonderful\" but I don\\'t see it that way.  \\nElectronic surveillance has been an essential tool in preventing \\nserious crimes such as terrorist attacks and destabilizing organized crime.\\nThe economic benefits alone are estimated to be in the billions.  This\\nissue is not about snooping on innocent citizens but about doing what\\nwe can do prevent major crimes that could seriously disrupt other\\nliberties.  The problem is likely to get even worse if criminals know\\nthey use the telecommunications systems without any chance of getting\\ncaught.\\n\\n3.  My proposal was to register your private key with a trustee, \\ndifferent from the government.  The key would be encrypted under some\\nother public key so the trustee couldn\\'t decrypt it.  I have suggested\\nit be the key of the DOJ, but it could be another independent trustee.\\nI believe this would provide acceptably good protection since someone\\nwould need to get a court order and then the cooperation of 3 agencies\\nto get at your communications: the telecommunications provider (to get\\nthe bit stream), the first trustee (to get the encrypted key), and\\nthe second to decrypt it.  Experience with the telecom providers has\\nbeen that they are very fussy about court orders -- you have to get\\nthe semicolons right!\\n\\nYou can get even more security by using Silvio Micali\\'s \"fair \\npublic-key cryptosystem\" approach.  Called \"fair\" because it is \\ndesigned to strike a balance between the needs of the Government and\\nthose of the citizens.  With his approach, you would break your key\\nup into 5 parts and give it to different trustees.  All 5 parts\\nare needed to reassemble it, but it is possible to veryify the parts\\nindividually and as a whole without putting them together -- \\ningenious!  He presented this at CRYPTO \\'92. \\n\\n4.  Someone suggested that law enforcement routinely taps without\\ncourt order.  This is an ungrounded claim for which I have never\\nseen any evidence.  Regardless, their ability to do this is \\ndisappearing with the new digital based technologies.  They need the\\nhelp of the service providers, who in turn ask for court orders.\\nCourt orders are not all that easy to get as law enforcers have to\\ndocument why other approaches have failed etc.\\n\\n5.  Many people have noted that you could not enforce key \\nregistration.  They may be right, but I am not throwing in the towel\\nyet.  Let\\'s take phones, which is what law enforcers are most \\ninterested in.  Products are emerging that you can attach to your\\nphone and that will do DES encryption.  Criminals and everyone\\nelse are most likely to use commercial products -- easiest to\\nget and cheapest.  The products could be designed so key registration\\nwould essentially be part of the sales process.\\n\\nThere can be social benefit to government regulation even when \\nregulation is not 100% successful.  None of our laws prevent the\\nacts they outlaw.  But this does not mean we should get rid of\\nall laws.  \\n\\n6.  Some people have said we should not give up our privacy to the\\ngovernment.  But the constitution does not give us absolute privacy.\\nWe are protected from unreasonable searches and seizures, but not\\nreasonable ones in response to \"probable cause\" of crime.  In all\\nareas of our lives, the government can invade our privacy if they\\nhave good reason to believe we are engaged in major criminal activity.\\nThey can break into our homes, our safes, and so on.  Do we really\\nwant a society where electronic communications cannot ever be broken\\nwhen there is good reason to believe some major threat against society\\nis being planned?  \\n\\nThank you for your comments and for encouraging those on the other\\nnews groups to move over to sci.crypt.  I\\'ll try to keep up with\\nthis newsgroup and respond to other comments if appropriate, but\\nI honestly can\\'t track them all.\\n\\nDorothy Denning\\ndenning@cs.georgetown.edu (posting from guvax)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

Several years ago I posted to sci.crypt\\nmy \"novel\" idea for packing bits into the essentially inaudible \"least\\nsignificant bits\" (LSBs) of digital recordings, such as DATs and CDs.\\nDitto for the LSBs in an 8-bit image or 24-bit color image. I\\'ve since\\nseen this idea reinvented _several_ times on sci.crypt and\\nelsewhere...and I\\'m willing to bet I wasn\\'t the first, either (so I\\ndon\\'t claim any credit).\\n\\nA 2-hour DAT contains about 10 Gbits (2 hours x 3600 sec/hr x 2\\nchannels x 16 bits/sample x 44K samples/sec), or about 1.2 Gbytes. A CD\\ncontains about half this, i.e., about 700 Mbytes. The LSB of a DAT is\\n1/16th of the 1.2 Gbytes, or 80 Mbytes. This is a _lot_ of storage!\\n\\nA home-recorded DAT--and I use a Sony D-3 DAT Walkman to make\\ntapes--has so much noise down at the LSB level--noise from the A/D and\\nD/A converters, noise from the microphones (if any), etc.--that the\\nbits are essentially random at this level. (This is a subtle, but\\nimportant, point: a factory recorded DAT or CD will have predetermined\\nbits at all levels, i.e., the authorities could in principle spot any\\nmodifications. But home-recorded, or dubbed, DATs will of course not\\nbe subject to this kind of analysis.) Some care might be taken to\\nensure that the statistical properties of the signal bits resemble\\nwhat would be expected with \"noise\" bits, but this will be a minor\\nhurdle.\\n\\nAdobe Photoshop can be used to easily place message bits in the\\n\"noise\" that dominates things down at the LSB level. The resulting GIF\\ncan then be posted to UseNet or e-mailed. Ditto for sound samples,\\nusing the ideas I just described (but typically requiring sound\\nsampling boards, etc.). I\\'ve done some experiments along these lines.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t mean our problems are solved, of course. Exchanging tapes\\nis cumbersome and vulnerable to stings. But it does help to point out\\nthe utter futility of trying to stop the flow of bits.\\n\\n--Tim\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

(For those to\\nwhom this proposal is new, strange, or disturbing, please see the\\ndebate raging mainly in the newsgroup \"sci.crypt\".)\\n\\nOnce the principle is established that private communications,\\nletters, faxes, modem transmissions, etc. must be in a form\\nreadable--under court order, as Dorothy Denning\\'s proposal goes--by\\nthe government, and that \"public key encryption\" keys must be\\nregistered with the authorities, then we can expect the following:\\n\\n* _Classes_ of encryption keys, with some especially strong (in a\\ncryptograhic sense) keys being declared \"assault keys,\" just as\\ncertain classes of semiautomatic rifles have been branded \"assault\\nweapons\" and subjected to media villification and even confiscation by\\nthe authorities. In analogy with firearms, there may be \"Class 1\"\\ndealers in \"dangerous\" keys.\\n\\n* There may even be _bans_ on the registration (and hence use) of\\ncertain classes of algorithms and key lengths. For example,\\n\"civilians\" may be allowed to use DES, but not RSA. Or the key length\\nmay be restricted in various ways.\\n\\n* Strict controls over the types of algorithms allowed. After all,\\nwhat use will a key be if the government can\\'t run the algorithm?\\nThis, by the way, will be another way to control the spread of\\nencryption technology: if only licensed, inspected, and approved\\nalgorithms are acceptable to the key registration authorities,\\ninnovation and experimentation will suffer. This may make RSA Data\\nSecurity, Inc., very happy, as it may get the \"franchise,\" while users\\nof bootleg/contraband/experimental algorithms like PGP 2.0 (\"Pretty\\nGood Privacy\") face severe sanctions.\\n\\n* Spot checks will have to be done to ensure compliance. This may be\\ndone in various ways, such as by randomly checking bitstreams and\\ndemanding the sender open the message. (Note: Many have posted that\\nthis would not be possible. Untrue. The Rehnquist Supreme Court ruled\\na couple of years ago that the police could enter a bus and ask the\\npassengers to \"voluntarily\" accept a search of their baggage. Failure\\nto volunteer, so reasoned the court, constituted probable cause for a\\nsearch! \"Catch-22\" meets \"1984.\")\\n\\n* The penalties for noncompliance, or for hiding encrypted messages\\ninside other messages, will likely be severe, else widespread civil\\ndisobedience and claims of \"ignorance\" will result. (Personally, I\\n_expect_ widespread noncompliance. Many people will even flaunt their\\nnoncompliance, encrypting truly innocuous messages that few courts,\\nthey will hope, will convict them for. Here in California, the\\nnoncompliance rate for registration of those evil \"assault weapons\" is\\nestimated to be as high as 80%.)\\n\\n(My best guess is that the \"RICO\" (Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt\\nOrganizations Act) and civil forfeiture approaches will be used to\\nsimply seize the equipment of anyonone caught sending messages without\\nthe suitable seals of approval. Such seizures, used with suspected gun\\nsellers, suspected X-rated video sellers, suspected drug dealers. and\\nso on, have had a profoundly chilling effect.)\\n\\n* A registration system, even if well-intentioned and secured against\\ncasual government snooping (and some of the multi-party escrow systems\\nmay help do this), will still _greatly complicate_ the use of encryption\\nand will forestall certain very exciting applications of cryptology.\\nMany of the new proposals, for things like anonymous credentials to\\nprotect privacy, for digital cash, and for cryptographic voting\\nsystems, essentially require the _dynamic_ generation of keys! That\\nis, keys are generated frequently as part of the protocols...there is\\nnot single static \"public key\" that one generates once and then takes\\ndown to the crypto equivalent of the DMV for registration.\\n\\n* As with guns, true criminals will of course ignore these laws.\\nComputer networks are already being used for messages that evade\\nwiretaps (as one example, a Mafia guy in New Jersey, on the run, used a\\nwell-known computer service to communicate untraceably with his wife),\\nthat are used for laundering information and money, and so on. Taking\\nencryption away from citizens will do nothing.\\n\\n\\nI urge readers to get involved in this debate.\\n\\n\\n\"If encryption is outlawed, only outlaws--and the NSA--will have encryption.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

I believe that all the parti-\\n: cipants in this discussion would agree that: When the Government\\n: can show, through legitimately obtained evidence, that a particular\\n: encrypted communication relates to a crime, then they can, after\\n: the fact, subpoena the plaintext of that communication.  What\\n: most of us object to is having to yield the keys before the fact.\\n\\nAgreed. The current procedure for subpoenaing documents works fairly\\nwell.\\n\\nBut Prof. Denning\\'s comments clearly indicate the concern is with\\ncatching terrorists, kidnappers, subversives, and other such types _in\\nthe planning stage_. That is, wiretapping and surveillance.\\n\\nAnd I\\'ll got out on a limb, too. My suspicion, and that of many\\nothers, is that the case of the FBI catching terrorists before the act\\nin the U.S. (and there\\'s a well-known case of a Japanese Red Army\\nterrorist caught in the Midwest several years ago) reveals the sources\\nthe FBI uses. The NSA is the likely source. Only the NSA listening in\\non millions of telephone conversations (not banned by any law...the\\nlaws you hear about on wiretapping and surveillance mostly deal with\\nthe FBI, law enforcement, and, supposedly, the CIA. The NSA is almost\\ncompletely exempt from such laws.).\\n\\nIf you haven\\'t yet read James Bamford\\'s \"The Puzzle Palace,\" run out\\nand get a copy and read it. You\\'ll see why former DIRNSA General Odom\\ncalled Bamford \"an unindicted felon.\" (Why in the eyes of the National\\nSecurity Establishment, that is.)\\n\\nSIGINT OPERATION MINARET, begun in 1969 when Nixon declared the \"War\\non Drugs,\" brought the NSA together with the FBI, CIA, BNDD (Bureau of\\nNarcotics and Dangerous Drugs, precursor to DEA) to launch a series of\\nnew surveillance programs. In May 1970 the NSA extended routine\\nsurveillance to _pay phones_ in suspect areas (sound familiar, with\\nthe Digital Telephony Bill?). The release of the Pentagon Papers in\\n1971 revealed the extent of FBI and NSA elsur (electronic\\nsurveillance) on U.S. citizens.\\n\\nOPERATION SHAMROCK goes back even further. Beginning in 1945, the FBI\\nand NSA (its precursors, actually, such as Army Signal Corps, etc.)\\ncooperated to monitor dissidents, radicals, authors, etc. It was not\\nuntil October 1973 that about-to-be-fired Attorney General Elliot\\nRichardson (now fighting for INSLAW in a very similar case, which\\nProf. Denning ought to read about) ordered the FBI and the CIA\\'s\\n\"Security Service\" (aptly named SS) to stop requesting NSA\\nsurveillance material. In 1977 the Justice Department recommended\\nagainst prosecution of the FBI and NSA employees engaged in Shamrock\\nand Minaret.\\n\\nFew Americans understand how pervasive is the NSA\\'s listening system.\\nCOINTELPRO, Huston Plan, RCA Global (provided copied of all telegrams\\nfor 40 years!), FINCEN, and so many other keywords! Huge antennas in\\nWest Virginia, in Idaho, and elsewhere (mostly located near major\\nsatellite downlinks). Read Bamford\\'s book. Then be afraid....be _very_\\nafraid.\\n\\nUnderstand that there are virtually no laws governing the NSA\\'s\\nsurveillance of fax machines, modems, the Internet (including all of\\nthese postings, obviously), voice phones, telex and TWX, and on and\\non. Because of the \"national security\" role, wide lattitude is given. \\n\\nNo doubt some criminal plans are uncovered. The NSA detected, it has\\nbeen admitted, the planned bombing of the Berlin discotheque that led to\\nthe \\'86 raid on Libya. (However, the bombing still occurred...draw your\\nown conclusions.) But is it worth the price?\\n\\nNow there is talk of using the NSA\\'s formidable listening abilities\\nfor economic espionage against our economic opponents! \\n\\nIs it any wonder the NSA is scared sh..less over the spread of secure\\nand untappable communications systems?\\n\\nBe afraid, be _very_ afraid.\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

(Variations on \\n AA> read every fifth word to see the real message, or other standard \\n AA> methods).\\n\\n It\\'s funny you should bring that up.  One of the major proponents of \\nencryption here in Region 12 posted the following in the Regional Sysop Echo \\nsome time ago... \\n\\n=============================================================================\\n\\nHaving said that, I also wonder whether this insistence upon having\\neverything in plain text isn\\'t fostered by some sysops as a means of\\nreceiving information that they otherwise wouldn\\'t be privy to. If\\none is truly paranoid ( *not* that I would fall into that category \\nin anyone\\'s wildest dreams...ahem), one should worry about why some\\nnetmail is read so assiduosly by passthrough systems in the first place.\\n \\nFortunately, even mail that I send direct to nodes is quoted back and\\noften passes through a whole variety of systems for their inspection and\\nreview.\\n \\nSince almost all of my netmail is incredibly innocent there might\\nalways be the possibility that some of it will come back to hover\\nlike a bad dream in some creative complaint. In broader legal terms,\\nevery other communication system avoids eavesdropping on mail.\\n \\n \\nP.S. To understand how powerless you  are to prevent encrypted text, read \\nthe leftmost letter of each sentence in the last three paragraghs \\ndownwards...ahem.\\n \\n===========================================================================\\n\\n He raises a valid point.  Sysops who are so paranoid about encrypted mail \\nbeing sent through their systems should realize that they are really powerless \\nto prevent it if somebody is determined enough to send a coded message to \\nsomebody else.  \\n\\n I\\'ve sought legal opinions in Canadian law (I don\\'t know how it is in the \\nU.S.) and I\\'ve discovered that the less I know about mail passing through my \\nsystem, the safer I am.  If I keep every message on my system, and read them \\nall, then I can be held liable if somebody routes something illegal through my \\nsystem and it slips by me.  If I kill all passthrough mail, and read nothing \\nexcept what is addressed to me, I am operating under common carrier status, \\nand can\\'t be held liable any more than Federal Express or UPS could.\\n\\n As a result, it\\'s actually better to *encourage* people to send encrypted \\nmail through your system.  The belief that if people are sending encrypted \\nmail they\\'re doing something wrong is a fallacy... then again, I\\'m preaching \\nto the converted here.\\n\\nCheers,\\n Jesse.\\n\\n\\n--- Maximus 2.01wb\\n * Origin: On a Clear Disk You Can Seek Forever (1:225/1)\\n--  \\ntom jennings - via FidoNet node 1:125/555\\n    UUCP: ...!uunet!hoptoad!kumr!fidogate!111!tom.jennings\\nINTERNET: tom.jennings@f111.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: mark@coombs.anu.edu.au (Mark)\\nDate: Wed, 28 Oct 92 18:09:15 PPE\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: How far would this extend...\\nMessage-ID: <9210290109.AA29045@coombs.anu.edu.au>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nWith regard to the FBI bill, the definition of electronic communication\\nprovider is rather vague IMHO.

The problem is cost and time: each copy costs me about\\n$2.00 and there are more than 100 people on this list. Any ideas?\\n\\nI also have a fresh copy of RSA\\'s 52-page FAQ (which is also available\\nby ftp, but many folks have had problems printing it). The same\\ncalculation applies.\\n\\nWhatever the solution, I will only make one \"copy run,\" as I don\\'t\\nwant to be a document distribution service on a continuing basis.\\nUntil a solution appears, PLEASE DO NOT SEND ME REQUESTS, MONEY, ETC.\\n\\nBTW, this applies to PGP 2.0 diskettes as well. I just mailed a\\ndiskette to someone who\\'d been unable to get the ftp\\'ed version. (And\\nmy diskette came from someone on this list, too...thanks!) I didn\\'t\\nask for postage or diskette fees, but I clearly can\\'t do this with\\ndozens of folks. And yet it seems we ought to find a way to do this.\\n\\nOne idea is to put our ideas into practice by having some kind of\\n\"escrow service\" which holds deposited money (small amounts, given the\\nitems discussed here) and which can be used to buy small items, with\\npayments handled electronically (ultimately settled with actual\\nchecks, of course). This could get out of hand, of course, so it\\'s\\njust an idea. Any comments?\\n\\nP.S. And don\\'t forget to make your suggestions on the Crypto session\\nat Hackers.

Because I use a Mac and the Mac version is not out yet.\\n\\n9. Because the Mac version may NEVER be out.\\n\\n8. Because my old IBM PC won\\'t read the 3.5\" diskettes my Mac puts\\nout.\\n\\n7. Because downloading encrypted files with ZMODEM, writing them to\\nDOS format (with Apple File Exchange), hauling out my Toshiba 1000SE\\nlaptop and firing it up, loading the 3.5\" diskette, and then running\\nPGP takes 5 minutes per message.\\n\\n6. Because after doing all of the above, I usually get \"This is not a\\nPGP file,\" due to some obscure mistranslation somewhere along the way.\\n\\n5. Because I barely have the time to read and respond to my ordinary\\ne-mail, let alone decrypt mail, respond (on my DOS machine), and then\\nreverse the above procedure.\\n\\n4. Because I\\'m not yet convinced it is needed. It will be someday, but\\nnot for right now. (Getting PGP volume up is a great idea...it\\'s the\\nactual decryption that\\'s a pain. Maybe we ought to send dummy\\nmessages.)\\n\\n3. Because ideally our mailers should handle this in a push-button way\\n(I know about the security flaws in having a nonlocal host machine,\\nsuch as my NETCOM host, do the PGP procedure...I am hoping that\\nsomeone will write something that transparently \"reaches down\" into my\\nmachine and triggers the computation locally on my machine--and I need\\na Mac version, of course. Probably an off-line Newsreader for the Mac,\\nlike Nuntius, is needed.)\\n\\n2. Because I don\\'t give out my PGP key (generated on my Toshiba) to\\nall of those who have e-mailed me about it (especially in the wake of\\nmy postings about the Denning proposal). The last thing I want is more\\ne-mail from people I\\'ve never met, sending me their encrypted secrets\\nof the universe.\\n\\n(...and the Number One reason I don\\'t use PGP?.....)\\n\\n1. Because computers were supposed to make my life easier, and they\\nhaven\\'t. \\n\\nWell, that\\'s enough reasons. I guess I\\'m just lazy, or have higher\\npriorities than to spend 5 frustrating minutes per mail message.\\nIronically, I\\'m not alone.

There are so many different ways in which people read\\nand send mail.\\n\\nA lot of people receive their mail on some other machine, often\\na multi-user machine.  So, the first question is, should the mail\\nbe crypted there, or should it be crypted on your personal machine.\\nThe second choice is preferable from the security point of view,\\nbut that means that you need to download at least your PGP mail\\nin order to decrypt it, and it means you have to compose your\\nmail on your home machine before encrypting, uploading, and sending.\\n\\n(Phil Zimmermann had an idea for multi-user systems in which the\\nRSA portion of the decryption, which involves your secret key, would\\nbe done on your personal machine, then the decrypted session key\\nwould be uploaded to the multi-user machine and the IDEA decryption\\ndone on the message itself.  This way you only have to upload and\\ndownload a couple hundred bytes regardless of the length of the\\nmessage.  This would require PGP to be integrated into a terminal\\nprogram.)\\n\\nIf you _do_ download your mail before reading it, you could get in\\nthe habit of downloading _all_ of your mail into a big file, then\\nrunning a word processor or some more specialized program to\\nread the messages, one at a time, and compose replies.  Then, when\\nyou were done, you could upload and send the replies.\\n\\nIf you worked in this mode, which probably few people do, you could\\nintegrate PGP by running it on the downloaded mail file before running\\nyour WP to read it.  I have a Perl script which runs PGP on a file,\\nfinding the PGP messages in it, decrypting them, and replacing them\\n_in_the_file_ with their decrypted versions.  (Normally PGP outputs\\nits decrypted contents to another file, which is a little inconvenient.)\\nThis can make PGP pretty transparent for decryption if you actually\\nread your mail in this way.\\n\\nAnother possibility is to use a WP or mail reading program which has\\na \"filter\" mode, one which lets you pass incoming or outgoing mail\\nthrough some program, and replace the mail with the results of that\\nprogram.  I don\\'t know which programs can do this.  A lot of Unix\\nprograms can, like VI and EMACS, but I don\\'t know about PC\\'s or other\\nhome machines.  PGP has a filter mode which is designed to be used with\\nWP\\'s which can do this.  There have been a couple of messages on\\nalt.security.pgp which have advice on using PGP with various Unix mail\\nreading programs.  Mark Riordan\\'s soon-to-be-released RIPEM program\\n(an alternative, incompatible, RSA public-key program) has some ideas\\nin its manual on how to use its filter mode with Unix mail, which mostly\\napply to PGP as well.\\n\\nOne other point: regarding a Mac port: There have been at least a couple\\nof messages on alt.security.pgp over the past couple of months from\\npeople who have successfully compiled the PGP sources under Think C\\non the Mac.  However, as a Unix/PC program, it ends up using a character\\nwindow for I/O, which you type into just like you would on a PC.\\nThis is unacceptable for Macs, so nobody has released one of these.\\nStill, compared to what Tim has to do, it would be an improvement.  I\\nthink people should release their executables which work like this as\\nan interim crutch version until the real Mac version is available.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Tom.Jennings@f111.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG (Tom Jennings)\\nDate: Sat, 31 Oct 92 13:31:32 PPE\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: re: Why I Don\\'t Use PGP...\\nMessage-ID: <3400.2AF2EC7B@fidogate.FIDONET.ORG>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n U> From: 74076.1041@CompuServe.COM (Hal)\\n\\n U> The best way to integrate PGP into other software is a \\n U> tough\\n U> question.

This is \\nnot counting the NSA\\'s monitoring of all the international traffic\\nthey can stuff into a computer.\\n\\nNow the FBI wants telephone switch manufactures to supply them\\nwith desktop phone tapping technology. Real-time delivery of all\\nconversations straight to the agent\\'s desk. This is scary, but it might\\nan opportunity. \\n\\nGiven that congress is likely to eventually allow the FBI this tech toy,\\nwould you go along with a deal that all taps  would really require a\\ncourt order and that the exact time and location of all taps would\\neventually be made public? No cheating possible.\\n\\nI believe such an compromise may be possible via cyptographic\\ntechnology, I\\'ve not worked out the details, but here is a sketch\\nof the idea. \\n\\nThe legislation authorizing the tapping facilities would require that each tap\\nbe activated by a key supplied by a court. Each tap\\nwould require a new key. The switching gear would not only\\nenforce the key mechanism, but transmit a record of the tap to some \\nagency outside  the court system. Both the courts and this \\nagency would be required to periodically make public all old taps. \\nPart of this information would include tamper-proof sequence codes and\\nsignatures to guarantee that all taps were in fact reported.\\n\\nThe law would effectively be enforced by the switch hardware. We\\nwould not only know how many phones were tapped, but whose \\nphones were tapped. This last would pose a privacy problem, The law could just\\nrequire tappees being eventually informed of the\\ninvasion of their lives, rather than public disclosure.\\n\\nProblems: \\n\\n* We consent to the process, it legitimates phone taps.\\n\\n* The hardware would be in place for massive monitoring of\\ncommunications if the government could get the public to\\naccept dropping the limitations of the scheme. [It might\\nbe possible to limit the abuse by having the switches\\ncommunicate and not accept anymore than a 1,000 taps a\\nyear.]\\n\\n* The lobbying for this would be difficult.\\n\\nAdditional opportunity:\\n\\n* By proposing and lobbying for this type of scheme, it could\\nbe made obvious that the cops and mega cops want to maintain\\nmuch closer surveillance than they are willing to admit.

No compromise on that.  Period.  We\\'ve all heard the arguements many\\ntimes: vast surveillance power, diminution of privacy, potential major\\nsecurity problems...  \\n\\nI\\'d like to suggest something of a compromise which doesn\\'t have these\\nrisks.  Common carriers (local and long distance telcos) are currently\\nrequired to provide access to line terminals when presented with a court\\norder for a wiretap.  This access could reasonably be extended to requiring\\nthe telco to connect a demultiplexer in the case of digital transmission, or\\nsome kind of appropriate signal splitter in the case of fiber optics.  The\\nagency requesting the tap would of course pay the bill for materials and\\nlabor.  Now this gets law enforcement their demultiplexed signal path so\\nthey can tap only the intended target line, but it preserves the existing\\nstructure which prevents law enforcement \"hacking,\" since no backdoors would\\nbe involved. \\n\\nFor PBXs (this is my department), a slightly distasteful but acceptable\\ncompromise would be to have interconnect companies (the folks who install\\nyour PBX or key system) register with the local operating telcos, providing\\nthe interconnect company\\'s name and contact information on the telco record\\nfor each subscriber.  So for instance, General Widgets has XYZ Telecom\\ninstall a new PBX; XYZ Telecom is required to inform the local operating\\ncompany that they have just acquired General Widgets as a client. Now if a\\nlaw enforcement agency gets a court order for a tap, they go to the local\\ntelco and ask who the interconnect company is for that subscriber.  (We\\'re\\ntalking here about a scenario in which one or a small number of extensions\\nin a phone system are believed to be used for criminal purposes, so law\\nenforcement has to tap those extensions only and not everyone who is on that\\nphone system.)  Now law enforcement visits the interconnect company and\\npresents them with the court order, which requires the interconnect company\\nto provide access to the line terminals of the suspect extension(s), and/or\\nprovide a demultiplexer etc. if needed (at law enforcement\\'s expense of\\ncourse)... and of course, under penalty of contempt of court, refrain from\\ndisclosing the situation to the client.  \\n\\nNow this gets law enforcement their legitimately needed access to suspect\\nextensions on PBXs, prevents interconnect companies from blowing the whistle\\nto their clients, and still preserves privacy protections since there is no\\nbackdoor into the system.  \\n\\nNow here is why I think the FBI wants backdoors:  Recall that under the \"war\\non drugs\" etc., a ruling was handed down (I can\\'t recall which branch of\\ngovt originated this) which says that a wiretap may be conducted for up to\\n72 hours for \"investigational purposes\" without a court order; and the\\nmaterial recorded may then be used to go and get a court order for a\\ncontinuing wiretap.  This places authority in the hands of law enforcement\\nagencies to conduct taps any time they suspect someone of something, and\\nthen go see the judge after the fact.  Now without backdoors, law\\nenforcement has to depend on the goodwill of telcos to get access, and is\\nkind of stuck when it comes to PBXs and key systems.  I\\'m willing to bet\\nthere is a pretty substantial amount of \"investigational\" tapping going on,\\nand that the FBI is interested in vastly expanding it.  The compromises I\\'m\\nproposing don\\'t address this investigational tapping, and that\\'s just fine,\\nsince that ought to be challenged in court or defeated one way or another.\\n\\n-gg@well\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: gnu\\nDate: Fri, 6 Nov 92 05:03:26 PPE\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com, gnu\\nSubject: 1993 RSA Data Security Conference\\nMessage-ID: <9211061203.AA20359@toad.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nRSA is putting on a conference on public key cryptography on the SF\\npeninsula on January 14th (conference) and 15th (tutorials and\\nexposition).

I volunteered to look into this\\nwith the hopes of making a cheap and inexpensive device that has\\n2 DB-9 connectors (Serial through box) to be used to generate random\\nserial data at a particular baud rate.\\n\\nToday,  I called Newbridge Micro,  they faxed me the data sheets,  and\\ngave me the number for a local rep in San Jose.   (408) 258-3600,\\nbut I was appalled at the price.    They wanted $52.50 each in\\n100 quantity.   So it is clear that if I use this chip,  which really\\nis a hybred,   I cannot charge $50 each.    So we have to decide\\nwhat to do,   or how much more it will cost.\\n\\nAfter examining the data sheet,  the chip is probed by a pulse,  and\\na bit comes out with an equal probability of a \"1\" or a \"0\".   Sorta\\nlike a coin toss.  \\n\\nI think that the perifery cost of the other electronics,   such as\\nshift registers,  or UART which would be necessary to clock the bits\\ninto an 8 bit register,  etc,  would cost about $6 - $8 in cost,  then\\nI will have to fab the boards.

It would cost $150 setup charge for the\\nPC boards and $2 per board. \\n\\n1 ea  RBG1210           $52.50\\n1 ea  PC board\\t\\t $2.00\\nvarious chips\\t\\t $8.00\\nSetup \\t\\t\\t $1.50   (1/100th setup charge)\\n\\nTotal parts\\t\\t$63.50  (100 quantity) \\n\\nCost (4 X parts)       $254.00   \\n\\nSo,  it is clear that the cost is rather high,   and not everyone can\\nafford this.     But if you think that people will want to buy it at\\nthat price,    I can go ahead and do it,    but the cost to me would\\nbe about $250 to build just one of them,  and I have someone who can\\nloan me the money to make a prototype.   This also includes design\\ntime and use of an electronics lab to test and get it running.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t be able to borrow $6350 to build 100 of them,  and I think\\nI can talk the rep into letting me purchase them in smaller quantity,\\nso I can build them on demand.    I\\'m just not so sure that people will\\nwant to pay $254 for one of these.    So please lets discuss this,  \\namong our group to determine if this price is reasonable.\\n\\nAlthough,   it IS possible to use a cesium noise source (Don\\'t know\\nthe cost of that)  and perhaps I can cut that price down by about\\na half or a third,  but the design time would be much increased,\\nand perhaps there would be twice as much electronics,  and perhaps\\nthe posibility that the randomness won\\'t be as good.\\n\\nJohn D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: pozar@kumr.lns.com (Tim Pozar)\\nDate: Mon, 9 Nov 92 15:09:09 PST\\nTo: crunch@netcom.com (John Draper)\\nSubject: Re: Analysis of cost to produce random serail generator.\\nIn-Reply-To: <9211092136.AA25999@netcom2.netcom.com>\\nMessage-ID: <m0moiDw-0000egC@kumr.lns.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nJohn Draper wrote:\\n> [...]\\n> So,  it is clear that the cost is rather high,\\n> [...]\\n> Although,   it IS possible to use a cesium noise source\\n> [...]\\n> John D.\\n\\n  Geez...

The address \"cypherpunks@toad.com\" is mentioned, so we may get\\neven more new folks. Also some good stuff on MindVOX, phreaking, etc.\\n\\n--Tim\\n\\n\\nHACKERS CONFERENCE REPORT\\n\\nI just returned from Hackers 8.0, held 6-8 November in Lake Tahoe,\\nCalifornia. Approximately 170 attendees this year.\\n\\nSome Highlights:\\n\\n* Our crypto session went extremely well. The talks were on PGP and\\nFidoNet, Diffie-Hellman key exchange for rlogin, digital\\ntime-stamping, and anonymous remailers. More comments later.\\n\\n* Mike Godwin of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) spoke on the\\ndeveloping conflict between personal privacy and law enforcement,\\nincluding comments on the \"key registration\" trial balloon I posted\\nabout earlier. (Godwin told me he believes the Denning proposal is\\ndeadly serious, that the Department of Justice has put a high priority\\non limiting the use of cryptography.)\\n\\n* Hacking was well represented. Besides our crypto panel, sessions on\\ncellular phone phreaking and illegal mods to telecom equipment drew\\nlarge crowds (a \"how to\" talk on reprogramming the 8051 micro in the\\nOki 900 cellphone was especially useful).\\n\\n* Eric Drexler gave a talk on nanotechnology (surprise!), with an\\nemphasis on needed work in the next couple of years. Drexler argued\\nthat proto-assemblers could be built in as short as 16 years, though\\nthere was some skepticism expressed. He also presented a calculation\\nthat the \"cost\" of delaying nanotech is $25 billion a _day_. (I\\nsuggested we all skip dinner that night and instead put in another\\nhour in the labs!)\\n\\n* Marvin Minsky answered questions, saying he rarely prepares in\\nadvance. AI, robotics, gene expression in embryos, and software were\\nall covered.\\n\\n* Allan Huang of AT&T gave an energetic 90 minute talk on optical\\ncomputing, going from optical deconvolvers to \"computer origami\" to\\noptical switches to Sagnac fibers that can store light pulses 6\\nfemtoseconds long! Definitely the most stimulating talk.\\n\\n* Demos in the machine room were better than ever. The \"Reality\\nEngine\" from Silicon Graphics displayed photorealistic simulations.\\nLots of Suns, NeXTs, and Macs. Films of SIGGRAPH papers, chaos and\\nfractals, and artificial life were shown at night. Rudy Rucker\\'s\\nsession on cellular automata went well.\\n\\n\\n\\nMORE ON CRYPTO\\n\\nSince cryptology and the activities of the \"cypherpunks\" mailing list\\nare of central concern to me, I\\'ll concentrate on those topics.\\n\\nOur panel was in \"prime time,\" mid-Saturday afternoon, with about 100\\nin attendance, including a couple of journalists (notably John Markoff\\nof the \"New York Times\"...if anybody sees an article on this by him,\\nplease send me a note about it, OK?). The audience had been prepped\\nfor crypto by the comments Friday night by Mike Godwin of the EFF and\\nby a 3 hour rump session on \"Digital Cash\" from 1 a.m. to 4 a.m on\\nSaturday (remember \"hacker hours\").\\n\\nTom Jennings, one of the chief forces behind FidoNet, an \"anarchic\"\\nnet made up of PCs talking to other PCs, spoke on efforts to spread\\nPGP (Pretty Good Privacy) to as many FidoNet users as possible. It\\nlooks like its happening and this will be another avenue to ensure\\nthat the \"crypto genie\" gets safely out of the bottle.\\n\\nJohn Gilmore, an early UNIX/Sun pioneer and current principal at\\nCygnus Support, amongst other things, spoke on increasing security\\nagainst Internet eavesdroppers by using the Diffie-Hellman key\\nexchange protocol for rlogin (for example). This is something we can\\ndo fairly soon.\\n\\nStu Haber and Scott Stornetta of Bellcore (formerly part of Bell Labs)\\nreported on their digital time-stamping system. Some document to be\\n\"notarized\" is hashed to produce a fairly short number which is hard\\nto forge (i.e., it is very hard to find another document which hashes\\nto the same value). This hash value is then published in, say, a\\nwidely read newspaper. If a dispute arises about the time a document\\nwas written, the published has value is persuasive. Bellcore actually\\noperates such a service (check the legal notices in the Sunday \"New\\nYork Times\").\\n\\nEric Hughes, a mathematician who worked briefly for David Chaum\\'s\\n\"DigiCash\" outfit, described anonymous remailers implemented in Perl\\nand now running. He also mentioned Hal Finney\\'s version which embeds\\nPGP in the remailer, allowing more security. This generated a lot of\\nexcitement, as the ideas of \"crypto anarchy\" became apparent to all.\\n\\n(John Little, owner and operator of the \"Portal Communications\\nCompany,\" a Bay Area-based Internet access service, got excited and\\noffered to run the remailers on his system! The genie is further out\\nof the bottle. Now if we can only get GEnie to do the same!)\\n\\nThe spirit of contributing to the larger cause of using crypto to\\n_directly_ protect privacy was exhilarating. More people spoke of\\nactual code they plan to write (as with Russell Whittaker\\'s offer a\\nfew weeks ago to help with ProComm mods). \\n\\nThere was a real sense that Things Had Changed. With PGP 2.0 arriving\\na few months ago (and still spreading), with the onset of the\\n\"Cypherpunks\" group (which got a somehat cryptic write-up by Jude\\nMilhon in the just-published Issue #8 of \"Mondo 2000\"...but since she\\ncoined the term \"cypherpunks\" to describe us, her article can afford\\nto be cryptic, no?), and with the \"Hacker Crackdown\" all around us\\n(Sun Devil, Legion of Doom, S.266 attempt to ban encryption, FBI\\'s\\n\"Digital Telephony Bill,\" and the latest \"trial balloon\" to register\\nkeys), the time is right.\\n\\nIn the next several months I expect the media, via more articles in\\nmagazines like \"Mondo 2000\" and by articles on crypto policy, to focus\\nin on this issue. Even the \"Village Voice\" is interested in crypto issues\\n(theme: crypto privacy vs. Big Brother).\\n\\nThese are exciting times. If I\\'m ever busted for sedition, money\\nlaundering conspiracy, violation of the Munitions Act, RICO Act\\nviolations, or just plain old political incorrectness, carry on the\\nfight. The stakes are high.\\n\\n\\n--Tim\\n\\n--\\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

John Draper, who was there, expressed a desire to work on such a\\ndevice.  I forwarded him the information about the chip.\\n\\nWhat I didn\\'t know was the cost or design of this chip.  It appears to\\nuse a radioactive source to make random numbers.  This may account for\\nthe cost.  In any case, it is likely that most applications don\\'t need\\nthis kind of chip.\\n\\nWhat is needed, though, is _some_ kind of chip.  John Draper is eager\\nto manufacture such a device, once we have a design.  Would those\\npeople willing to help on this design please get in touch with him\\ndirectly and start a conversation about it.  The conversation could\\nreasonably be discussed on the list, if enough are interested.\\n\\nFYI, random numbers are used generally to create single-use session\\nkeys in a wide variety of crypto protocols, including Diffie-Hellman\\nkey exchange.  Hardware random number sources will be a standard\\ncomponent of all computers in the near future.\\n\\nAs far as the design of the device itself goes, the numbers that come\\nout of it don\\'t have to be fully random.  Non-randomness can be\\ncorrected in software.  Two characteristics of the output, though will\\nhelp such correction.  First, the number of ones and zeros should be\\nthe same.  Not only is this useful for correction, but it is easy to\\ndo in hardware.  Second, effort should be made to make sure that the\\ngenerator does not pick up cyclic noise from its environment.  This\\nmeans attention to coupling, shielding, and packaging.  No extra\\nexpense, likely, but definitely to be thought about some.\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Wed, 11 Nov 92 08:33:18 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Mac PGP version\\nMessage-ID: <9211111630.AA09056@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nI found the address for the Mac version of PGP.\\n\\nanon-ftp to mac.archive.umich.edu\\ndirectory /mac/util/encryption\\n\\nWould someone try this out and report back to the list how it works?\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: estensla@mipos2.intel.com (Erik Stensland)\\nDate: Wed, 11 Nov 92 09:12:11 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Remove my name please\\nMessage-ID: <9211111710.AA08221@mipos2>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease have my name removed from the mailing list!\\nThanks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

Getting 10K or more bits per second from a\\nradioactive soure usually means it is close enough/strong enough to\\n\"drift\" the device to the point of radiation-induced permanent failure\\nin a matter of weeks or months (if not much sooner, but this is all so\\ndependent on exact calculations and lab experiments).\\n\\nTony Patti, editor of a small crypto journal and frequent commentator\\non sci.crypt, is one of several folks who\\'ve designed thermal\\nnoise-based RNGs.

May)\\nSubject: A Silver Bullet to Limit Crypto?\\nDate: Wed, 11 Nov 1992 18:36:44 GMT\\n\\n\\nKey Registration as a \"Silver Bullet\" to Limit Crypto Use\\n\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, and more than 500 related messages ago, I posted the\\n\"Trial Balloon to Ban Encryption?\" message, alerting sci.crypt and\\nother newsgroups to the Dorothy Denning \"trial balloon.\" Prof. Denning\\nhas continued the balloon metaphor, calling her first proposal a \"lead\\nballoon\" and her improved, law-enforcement-friendly version a \"copper\\nballoon.\" Others have called it a \"uranium balloon,\" i.e., it\\'s worse\\nthan the lead balloon.\\n\\nIn reading the hundreds of comments about ways to bypass the Denning\\nproposal, about the many clever schemes to avoid detection, I came to\\nsome realizations about the likely reason for key registration. Also,\\nat the recent Hackers Conference in Lake Tahoe, lots of interesting\\npoints came up (crypto, PGP, anonymous remailers, digital cash,\\nprivacy, and the \"Crypto Crackdown,\" to borrow Bruce Sterling\\'s title\\nof \"The Hacker Crackdown,\" were hot topics). Mike Godwin of the EFF,\\nwho may be reading this in comp.org.eff.talk, spoke on such\\npolicies...he told us this kind of crackdown on crypto tools is a\\npriority of several government agencies and that the issue will not go\\naway with the new administration.\\n\\nBut why scheme to register keys, by whatever means, if the system is\\nso easily thwarted and bypassed? Neither Prof. Denning nor her\\ncolleagues, both in and out of the NSA and FBI, are dummies.\\n\\nThe \"silver balloon,\" or silver bullet, is this:\\n\\n* a formal key registration system will directly affect and limit use\\nof the _most important_ part of public key systems: the ability to use\\npublic key directories (like phone books) rather than set up all\\ncommunications on a one-to-one basis (as private key systems require,\\nfor key exchange, and as many of the key registration bypasses\\nimplicitly or explicitly require).\\n\\n* enforcement, at least for publicly announced P-K keys, can be by\\ninsisting that a special message (\"This is J. Random User.\") be signed\\nwith one\\'s registered/deposited key and then verified with the public\\nkey to ensure the same private key-public key pair is used. (Yes,\\nthere are still bypasses and clevernesses to spoof these systems, but\\nmost \"publicly visible\" use of P-K methods, the main raison d\\'etre for\\npublic keys, will be affected and effectively controlled.) Keys can\\nand will be registered under this proposal, but many people will\\nsimply not bother with the hassle and just won\\'t use P-K methods (thus\\nmaking the monitoring job easier).\\n\\n* bypassing the key registration laws by \"going underground\" is always\\npossible, but for this purpose one can already use one-time pads, pack\\nmessage bits into the least significant bits of digital recordings and\\nimages, and generally do all sorts of other devious things. The key\\npoint is that the wide use of public key methods is reduced, which may\\nbe the real motivation.\\n\\n* reducing the wide use of crypto technology by the masses allows the\\nmonitoring agencies a slightly easier job in monitoring those who\\n_are_ using crypto. One can imagine exactly the same arguments for\\nrestricting or registering voice scramblers for phone use: by\\nrequiring registration, fees, etc., many users will simply not bother\\nto use scrambling (and there may be related to spread the idea that\\nanyone using scrambling--or crypto in general--is somehow suspect,\\nmust have something to hide, etc.\\n\\n* the key registration ideas discussed so far severely limit use of\\ncrypto protocols that _dynamically_ generate lots of public keys.\\nCryptographic voting, most forms of digital cash, anonymous remailers,\\nand several other exciting uses all tend to generate a lot of keys \"on\\nthe fly.\" Are all of these to be registered? How? For how much money\\nper registration? And how long will it take? Weeks?\\n\\nInstead of concentrating on how these kinds of uses, mentioned by many\\npeople, effectively make the Denning/Rivest/Micali proposals\\nunworkable, we should look instead at how these proposals may _in\\nfact_ be aimed at limiting the explosive use of crypto for these new\\napplications. A government afraid of digital cash, of anonymous\\nremailing networks, of information markets in technologies, and of\\nlots of other interesting uses, may see key registration as a way to\\ncontain this explosion.\\n\\nEven if the private keys kept at the \"trusted key authority\" were\\n_never_ looked at by court order or otherwise, the key registration\\nact itself would place severe limits on the use of modern\\ncryptographic protocols for novel uses and for wide use by the public.\\n\\nIn this sense, the key registration idea may be a silver bullet, or\\nballoon, to head off these uses.

First,  I start with a clean screen,  then\\nplot the dots as they come in.     As these dots are plotted\\non the screen,   the dots should be evenly distributed over the\\nscreen without \"bunching\" or \"patterns\" developing.\\n\\n   I know that this is not the best way to determine true \\nrandomness,   but it is cheap and inexpensive to do.  \\n\\n   I also agree that we should all check out and determine if\\nthere are other random generators currently available,  and\\nwe should compile a list of them to share with the group as\\nproposed by Tim May.    Although I haven\\'t yet visited the\\ncrypt newsgroups,  I suspect that I should post a query there\\nto see if any such puppie exists.\\n\\n   Then,  there is the speed of generating these random numbers,\\nand how we will want to deal with the possibility of inadequate\\nspeed.     I suspect that serial transmission at 9500 baud might\\nbe easily obtained,   but going much faster withoug \"drift\" might \\nbe problematic as Tim May pointed out.\\n\\n   At this point,   I would now like to get some other feedback\\nfrom the group on what Zener noise source to use,   and kick \\naround some design ideas.    It would be nice to be able to exchange\\nschematic diagrams and pass them around.  I have a Mac,   but\\nnot everyone in this group uses them.    So what mechasim can we\\nimploy to send schematics around?\\n\\n   My next visit to the Nets will be this weekend,   so if anyone\\nwants to contact me,  they can try me at (510) 769-1268,  and\\nit will refer to the number where I\\'m staying at that time.\\nI still have NO permenent home (after long period of unemployment),\\nso getting on the Nets daily will be problematic for me.\\n\\n   I usually hang out in South San Jose,  at my friends VCR Repair\\nlab (where this hardware equipment is located),  but have no computer\\nset up there until we can set up proper physical security.   That\\nnumber is (408) 377-2382.   I am usually there early in the week,\\nbecause I can make calls to find work from there on Mondays.\\n\\n   As I converge into a workable design and if the lab results\\nare encouraging,   and acceptable to the group,   I would like to\\nbuild 2 or 3 prototypes and pass them around to volunteers for\\nBeta testing before making them available to the group as a whole.\\n\\n   I can get PC boards made via Douglas Electronics fairly \\ninexpensivly,   and plan on making them as orders come in,  and\\ninitial setup costs would be about $350.     I already have\\npeople set up to invest this much already.\\n\\n   Perhaps it would be prudent to set up a group of other HW\\ndesigners and meet physically somewhere to hammer out a design\\nand make this a group effort.   Do I have any volunteers?\\nI think only one meeting would be necessary to determine a rough\\napproach to take.\\n\\nJohn D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: karn@qualcomm.com (Phil Karn)\\nDate: Wed, 11 Nov 92 15:00:43 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: PGP problems with large key rings?\\nMessage-ID: <9211112300.AA06194@servo>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nI\\'m encountering problems when I try to form a large key ring (on the\\norder of 150 keys, each with several signatures).

Okay I admit it, I did\\nmiss the point of your proposal that any tapping be made the subject of a\\npublic record.  And basically I agree with you on that point.

They also\\npoint to parallels with voter registration:\\n\\nIt has been well-known for some time that requiring people to register some\\ntime in advance of an election, causes a decline in participation.  This\\ndecline is most evident among the disadvantaged sector of the population,\\nfor various reasons including inability to take time off from work.  Were\\nthe disadvantaged to vote en masse, they would most likely weigh in on the\\nside of substantial change, particularly change which would shift the\\nbalance of power in a more socially equitable direction.  As the\\npowers-that-be prefer to maintain the status quo, they are quite satisfied\\nwith the fact that the disadvantaged aren\\'t voting in larger numbers.\\nHence Republican administrations have (in recent history) blocked efforts to\\nsimplify and ease voter registration, as for instance the \"motor voter bill\"\\nwhich would automatically create a voter registration when someone gets a\\ndriver\\'s licence or car registration.\\n\\nThe United States is the world\\'s only remaining Western democracy which\\nrequires advance voter registration.  This practice had its roots in\\nattempts to prevent newly naturalised US citizens from voting, again, the\\nresult of prejudice and desire to maintain the status quo.  Now that the\\nDems are in power, we might consider tying the crypto key issue to the\\nelimination of voter registration, on the basis that both voting and digital\\ncommunication are forms of speech which should not be subjected to a\\nchilling effect.  \\n\\nRapid promulgation of decent user-friendly PKSs looks pretty essential at\\nthis point.  I\\'m thinking, how about approaching Apple to see if they\\'ll\\ninclude a PKS along with their Macs, as bundled software, sort of like\\nHypercard.  Even if the PKS which is used, has some problem with is, as for\\ninstance the old trapdoor-knapsack system, **anything** is preferable to\\nnothing at all when it comes to getting the public educated.  Does anyone\\nhere know any of the main people at Apple...?  What do you think they\\'d have\\nto say about bundling privacy software along with Macs?\\n\\n-gg\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Thu, 12 Nov 92 07:57:00 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: (fwd) A Silver Bullet to Limit Crypto?\\nIn-Reply-To: <199211121106.AA25693@well.sf.ca.us>\\nMessage-ID: <9211121557.AA25427@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nRe: tying voter and crypto registration issues togther.\\n\\nAn excellent idea, if both succeed.

The meetings are held in public\\nlocations on the first Friday evening of the month and the groups often\\ncontact each other by telephone during the meetings.\\n\\nCorley told Newsbytes that meetings were held that evening in New\\nYork, Washington, Philadelphia, Cambridge, St. Louis, Chicago,\\nLos Angeles and San Francisco. Corley said, \"While I am sure that\\nmeetings have been observed by law enforcement agencies, this is\\nthe only time that we have been harassed. It is definitely a\\nfreedom of speech issue.\"\\n\\nAccording to Craig Neidorf, who was present at the meeting and was\\ndistributing applications for membership in Computer Professionals\\nFor Social Responsibility (CPSR), \"I saw the security officers focusing\\non us. Then they started to come toward us from a number of\\ndirections under what seemed to be the direction of a person with\\na walkie-talkie on a balcony. When they approached, I left the\\ngroup and observed the security personnel encircling the group of\\nabout 30 gatherers. The group was mainly composed of high\\nschool and college students. The guards demanded to search the knapsacks\\nand bags of the gatherers. They confiscated material, including CPSR\\napplications, a copy of Mondo 2000 (a magazine), and other material.\"\\n\\nHe adds that the guards also confiscated film \"from a person trying\\nto take pictures of the guards. When a hacker called \"HackRat\"\\nattempted to copy down the names of the guards, they took his\\npencil and paper.\"\\n\\nNeidorf continued, \"I left to go outside and rejoined the group when they\\nwere ejected from the mall. The guards continued challenging the group\\nand told them that they would be arrested if they returned. When one of\\nthe people began to take pictures of the guards, the apparent supervisor\\nbecame excited and threatening but did not confiscate the film.\"\\n\\nNeidorf also said, \"I think that the raid was planned. They hit right about\\n6:00 and they identified our group as \"hackers\" and said that they knew\\nthat this group met every month.\"\\n\\nNeidorf\\'s story was supported by a Washington \"hacker\" called \"Inhuman,\"\\nwho told Newsbytes, \"I arrived at the meeting late and saw the group being\\ndetained by the guards. I walked along with the group as they were being\\nushered out and when I asked a person who seemed to be in authority his\\nname, he pointed at a badge with his name written in script on it.\\nI couldn\\'t make out the name and, when I mentioned that to the person,\\nhe said \\'If you can\\'t read it, too bad.\\' I did read his name,\\n\\'C. Thomas,\\' from another badge.\"\\n\\nInhuman also told Newsbytes that he was told by a number of people\\nthat the guards said that they were \"acting on behalf of the\\nSecret Service.\" He added, \"I was also told that there were two\\npolice officers from the Arlington County Police present but I\\ndid not see them.\"\\n\\nAnother attendee, Doug Luce, reports, \"I also got to the DC\\nmeeting very late; 7:45 or so. It seemed like a coordinated harassment\\nepisode, not geared toward busting anyone, but designed to get people\\nriled up, and maybe not come back to the mall.\"\\n\\nLuce adds that he overheard a conversation between someone who had\\nbrought a keyboard to sell. The person, he said, was harassed by\\nsecurity forces, one of whom said, \"You aren\\'t selling anything in\\nmy mall without a vendors permit!\"\\n\\nPossible Secret Service involvement was supported by a 19 year-old\\ncollege student known as the \"Lithium Bandit,\" who told\\nNewsbytes, \"I got to the mall about 6:15 and saw the group being detained\\nby approximately 5 Arlington County police and 5 security guards. When I\\nwalked over to see what was going on, a security guard asked me for an ID\\nand I refused to show it, saying that I was about to leave. The guard\\nsaid that I couldn\\'t leave and told me that I had to see a police\\nofficer. When I did, the officer demanded ID and, when I once again\\nrefused, he informed me that I could be detained for up to 10 hours\\nfor refusing to produce identification. I gave in and produced my\\nschool ID which the police gave to the security people who copied\\ndown my name and social security number.\"\\n\\nLithium Bandit continued, \"When I asked the police what was behind this\\naction, I was told that they couldn\\'t answer but that \\'the Secret\\nService is involved and we are within our rights doing this.\"\\n\\nThe boy says he and others later went to the Arlington police station\\nto get more information and were told only that there was a report\\nof the use of a stolen credit card and two officers were sent to\\ninvestigate. \"They later admitted that it was 5 [officers]. While I was\\ndetained, I heard no mention of a credit card and there was no one\\narrested.\"\\n\\nMarc Rotenberg, director of CPSR\\'s Washington office, told Newsbytes, \"I\\nhave really no details on the incident yet but I am very concerned\\nabout the reports. Confiscation of CPSR applications, if true, is\\noutrageous. I will find out more facts on Monday.\"\\n\\nNewsbytes was told by the Pentagon City Mall office that any information\\nconcerning the action would have to come from the director of security, Al\\nJohnson, who was not available until Monday. The Arlington Country\\nPolice referred Newsbytes to a \"press briefing recording\" which had not\\nbeen updated since the morning before the incident.\\n\\nCorley told Newsbytes, \"There have been no reports of misbehavior by any\\nof these people. They were obviously singled out because they were\\nhackers. It\\'s as if they were being singled out as an ethnic group. I\\nadmire the way the group responded -- in a courteous fashion. But it\\nis inexcusable that it happened. I will be at the next Washington\\nmeeting to insure that it doesn\\'t happen again.\"\\n\\nThe manager of one of New York state\\'s largest malls provided\\nbackground information to Newsbytes on the rights of malls to police those\\non mall property, saying, \"The primary purpose of a mall is to sell. The\\ninterior of the mall is private property and is subject to the\\nregulations of the mall. The only requirement is that the regulations\\nbe enforced in an even-handed manner. I do not allow political\\nactivities in my mall so I could not make an exception for Democrats.\\nWe do allow community groups to meet but they must request space at\\nleast two weeks before the meeting and must have proper insurance.\\nOur regulations also say that groups of more than 4 may not congregate\\nin the mall.\"\\n\\nThe spokeswoman added that mall security can ask for identification\\nfrom those who violate regulations and that they may be barred from the\\nmall for a period of 6 months.\\n\\nShe added, \"Some people feel that mall atriums and food courts are public\\nspace. They are not and the industry is united on this. If the malls were\\nto receive tax benefits for the common space and public service in snow\\nremoval and the like, it could possibly be a public area but malls are taxed\\non the entire space and are totally private property, subject to their own\\nregulations. If a group of 20 or more congregated in my mall, they would\\nbe asked to leave.\"\\n\\n---- article two ----\\nSubject: Secret Service Role Questioned in \"2600 Washington Raid\" 11/10/92\\nFrom: newsbytes@clarinet.com\\nDate: 10 Nov 92 21:03:23 GMT\\n\\nWASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1992 NOV 10 (NB) -- In the aftermath of an\\naction on Friday, November 6th by members of the Pentagon City Mall\\nPolice and police from Arlington County, VA in which those attending a\\n2600 meeting at the mall were ordered from the premises, conflicting\\nstories continue to appear.\\n\\nAttendees at the meeting have contended to Newsbytes that members of\\nthe mall police told them that they were \"acting on behalf of the\\nSecret Service.\" They also maintain that the mall police confiscated\\nmaterial from knapsacks and took film from someone attempting to\\nphotograph the action and a list of the names of security officers\\nthat one attendee was attempting to compile.\\n\\nAl Johnson, chief of security for the mall, denied these allegations\\nto Newsbytes, saying, \"No one said that we were acting on behalf of\\nthe Secret Service. We were merely enforcing our regulations. While\\nthe group was not disruptive, it had pulled tables together and was\\nhaving a meeting in our food court area. The food court is for\\npeople eating and is not for meetings. We therefore asked the\\npeople to leave.\"\\n\\nJohnson denied that security personnel took away any film or lists\\nand further said: \"We did not confiscate any material. The group\\nrefused to own up to who owned material on the tables and in the\\nvicinity so we collected it as lost material. If it turns out\\nthat anything did belong to any of those people, they are welcome\\nto come in and, after making proper identification, take the\\nmaterial.\"\\n\\nIn a conversation early on November 9th, Robert Rasor, Secret Service\\nagent-in-charge of computer crime investigations, told Newsbytes that\\nhaving mall security forces represent the Secret Service is not\\nsomething that was done and, that to his knowledge, the Secret\\nService had no involvement with any Pentagon City mall actions\\non the previous Friday.\\n\\nA Newsbytes call to the Arlington County police was returned by a\\nDetective Nuneville who said that her instructions were to refer all\\nquestions concerning the matter to agent David Adams of the Secret\\nService. She told Newsbytes that Adams would be providing all\\ninformation concerning the involvement of both the Arlington Police and\\nthe Secret Service in the incident.\\n\\nAdams told Newsbytes: \"The mall police were not acting as agents\\nfor the Secret Service. Beyond that, I can not confirm or deny\\nthat there is an ongoing investigation.\"\\n\\nAdams also told Newsbytes that: \"While I cannot speak for the\\nArlington police, I understand that their involvement was due to\\nan incident unrelated to the investigation.\"\\n\\nMarc Rotenberg, director of the Washington office of Computer\\nProfessionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), told Newsbytes\\nthat \"CPSR has reason to believe that the detention of people at\\nthe Pentagon City Mall last Friday was undertaken at the behest\\nof the Secret Service, which is a federal agency.\"\\n\\n\"If that is the case, then there was an illegal search of people\\nat the mall. There was no warrant and no indication of probable\\nillegal activity. This raises constitutional issues. We have\\nundertaken the filing of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\\nrequest to determine the scope, involvement and purpose of the\\nSecret Service in this action,\" he said.\\n\\n2600 meetings are held on the evening of the first Friday of each\\nmonth in public places and malls in New York City, Washington,\\nPhiladelphia, Cambridge, St. Louis, Chicago, Los Angeles and San\\nFrancisco. They are promoted by \"2600 Magazine: The Hacker Quarterly\"\\nand are attended by a variety of persons interested in\\ntelecommunications and so-called \"hacker issues.\"\\n\\nThe New York meeting, the oldest of its kind, is regularly attended\\nby Eric Corley a/k/a Emmanuel Goldstein, editor and publisher of 2600,\\nhackers, journalists, corporate communications professionals and other\\ninterested parties. It is known to have been the subject of\\nsurveillance at various times by law enforcement agencies conducting\\ninvestigations into allegations of computer crime.\\n\\nCorley told Newsbytes: \"While I\\'m sure that meetings have been\\nobserved by law enforcement agencies, this is the only time that\\nwe have been harassed. It\\'s definitely a freedom of speech\\nissue.\" Corley also that he plans to be at the December meeting\\nin Washington \"to insure that it doesn\\'t happen again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: omega@spica.bu.edu (The Omega)\\nDate: Thu, 12 Nov 92 10:50:30 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: DC 2600 -- Secret Service Involvement?\\nMessage-ID: <9211121850.AA01807@spica.bu.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nFor more info, see the recent Computer Underground Digest.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: nobody@alumni.cco.caltech.edu\\nDate: Thu, 12 Nov 92 13:52:59 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: No Subject\\nMessage-ID: <9211122154.AA13213@alumni.cco.caltech.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nI have a new address where I am running a cryptographically\\nprotected, anonymous remailer based on Eric Hughes\\' perl scripts.\\n\\nIt is: <hal@alumni.caltech.edu>.\\n\\nTo use the server, put \"Request-Remailing-To: <destination-address>\"\\ninto the header of the message, and send it to the above address.  If\\nyour mailer won\\'t let you put things into message headers, instead make\\nthe first line of your message body be just the two characters \"::\",\\nand make the next line be \"Request-Remailing-To: <destination-address>\",\\nand make the next line be blank.  The \"::\" tells the remailer to take\\nthe following lines, up to a blank one, and put them into the header.\\n\\nThis particular remailer has PGP integrated into it so that you can\\nencrypt your messages to the remailer.  That way a snooper can\\'t see\\nthe \"Request-Remailing-To\" information and can\\'t tell who you are\\nsending to.\\n\\nTo use this feature, create a message and put \"::\" and\\n\"Request-Remailing-To:\" lines at the beginning, followed by a blank\\nline.  Then encrypt this whole message, including these extra lines,\\nusing PGP with the remailer key below.  (Remember to use the -a flag\\nfor ASCII output.)\\n\\nNow, you have to do one more thing.  You have to put \"Encrypted: PGP\"\\ninto the message header when you send this message.  Again, if you\\ncan\\'t put stuff into message headers, you have to edit the PGP ASCII\\noutput file to add a line of \"::\", then a line saying \"Encrypted: PGP\",\\nthen a blank line.  This can then be sent to the address above.  It\\nwill decrypt the message, find the \"Request-Remailing-To\" line, and\\nforward it for you.\\n\\nThis machine is on the Internet so it should have nice, fast\\nturnaround.\\n\\nBe aware that this is a multi-user machine so the encryption is not\\nsuper secure.  Don\\'t bet your life on these messages not being broken.\\nThis is strictly experimental at this time.\\n\\nIf anyone would like help getting PGP or one of these remailers\\noperating on your local Unix machine, let me know and I will offer any\\nadvice that I can.  I would really like to see more people than just\\nEric and myself running remailers.\\n\\nThere is a more advanced capability made possible by the cryptographic\\nremailer, which is an \"anonymous return address.\"  The idea is, I can\\npost to a group like this, or a usenet group, using a pseudonym.  I\\nalso include my anonymous return address, which is basically my\\nregular return address, encrypted using the public key of a remailer.\\nPeople can use this anonymous return address to send to me by\\nforwarding it through the remailer, which decrypts the address, finds\\nout who I am, and sends it to me.  The people communicating to me\\ndon\\'t even have to know who I am, or what my email address is.  Two\\npeople could communicate using email, with both of their identities\\nbeing protected from the other.  This kind of capability can really\\nbe important in crypto-privacy.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\nP.S.

(A packet remailed through 10\\nremailers, each storing 10 such encrypted packets before remailing,\\nhas an intrinsic diffusivity of 10^10. Of course, there will be far\\nfewer than 10 billion messages, but the point is clear that the origin\\nof a message is effectively untraceable.) \\n\\n* the spread of PGP, onto Internet sites, FidoNet, and hacker boards,\\nIRCs, and the like. (I expect the adoption of PGP by the phone\\nhacker/phreaker community--the community so far the main target of\\nformal charges, as in the Legion of Doom, Len Rose, and Sun Devil\\ncases--is setting off alarms in the law enforcement community.)\\n\\n* the \"Hacker Crackdown\" spreading to \"2600\" (will Cyperpunks be next?\\nWill the 150-200 of us get raided?) and mere _meetings_ of hacker\\nfolks.\\n\\n* the incredible excitement over these topics at the Hackers\\nConference, with the sense that these are no longer just abstract\\nideas.\\n\\n* the interest by several journalists in covering these matters (more\\non this if things develop).\\n\\n* articles in \"Scientific American\" just in the past\\nmonths...David Chaum\\'s work on digital cash, and quantum cryptography.\\n\\n* the firestorm of comments (over 500) about the proposal to register\\ncryptographic keys. \\n\\nAll of these point to an accelerating situation. Things may get very\\ninteresting and very sticky in the next several months, which is quite\\na bit faster than I\\'d expected.\\n\\nJustice and the FBI may not wait until the next Administration to get\\nsomething started. Perhaps a high-publicity case involving drugs or\\nchild molestors will be used as a pretext to crack down. This\\ncrackdown may not need new laws...the existing conspiracy, RICI Act,\\nand espionage laws may be enough to \"set some examples.\"\\n\\nOur next Cypherpunks meeting (Saturday, 21 November) should look at\\nsome of these issues. \"Time is of the essence.\"\\n\\n--Tim\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

The meetings are held in public\\nlocations on the first Friday evening of the month and the groups often\\ncontact each other by telephone during the meetings.\\n\\nCorley told Newsbytes that meetings were held that evening in New\\nYork, Washington, Philadelphia, Cambridge, St. Louis, Chicago,\\nLos Angeles and San Francisco. Corley said, \"While I am sure that\\nmeetings have been observed by law enforcement agencies, this is\\nthe only time that we have been harassed. It is definitely a\\nfreedom of speech issue.\"\\n\\nAccording to Craig Neidorf, who was present at the meeting and was\\ndistributing applications for membership in Computer Professionals\\nFor Social Responsibility (CPSR), \"I saw the security officers focusing\\non us. Then they started to come toward us from a number of\\ndirections under what seemed to be the direction of a person with\\na walkie-talkie on a balcony. When they approached, I left the\\ngroup and observed the security personnel encircling the group of\\nabout 30 gatherers. The group was mainly composed of high\\nschool and college students. The guards demanded to search the knapsacks\\nand bags of the gatherers. They confiscated material, including CPSR\\napplications, a copy of Mondo 2000 (a magazine), and other material.\"\\n\\nHe adds that the guards also confiscated film \"from a person trying\\nto take pictures of the guards. When a hacker called \"HackRat\"\\nattempted to copy down the names of the guards, they took his\\npencil and paper.\"\\n\\nNeidorf continued, \"I left to go outside and rejoined the group when they\\nwere ejected from the mall. The guards continued challenging the group\\nand told them that they would be arrested if they returned. When one of\\nthe people began to take pictures of the guards, the apparent supervisor\\nbecame excited and threatening but did not confiscate the film.\"\\n\\nNeidorf also said, \"I think that the raid was planned. They hit right about\\n6:00 and they identified our group as \"hackers\" and said that they knew\\nthat this group met every month.\"\\n\\nNeidorf\\'s story was supported by a Washington \"hacker\" called \"Inhuman,\"\\nwho told Newsbytes, \"I arrived at the meeting late and saw the group being\\ndetained by the guards. I walked along with the group as they were being\\nushered out and when I asked a person who seemed to be in authority his\\nname, he pointed at a badge with his name written in script on it.\\nI couldn\\'t make out the name and, when I mentioned that to the person,\\nhe said \\'If you can\\'t read it, too bad.\\' I did read his name,\\n\\'C. Thomas,\\' from another badge.\"\\n\\nInhuman also told Newsbytes that he was told by a number of people\\nthat the guards said that they were \"acting on behalf of the\\nSecret Service.\" He added, \"I was also told that there were two\\npolice officers from the Arlington County Police present but I\\ndid not see them.\"\\n\\nAnother attendee, Doug Luce, reports, \"I also got to the DC\\nmeeting very late; 7:45 or so. It seemed like a coordinated harassment\\nepisode, not geared toward busting anyone, but designed to get people\\nriled up, and maybe not come back to the mall.\"\\n\\nLuce adds that he overheard a conversation between someone who had\\nbrought a keyboard to sell. The person, he said, was harassed by\\nsecurity forces, one of whom said, \"You aren\\'t selling anything in\\nmy mall without a vendors permit!\"\\n\\nPossible Secret Service involvement was supported by a 19 year-old\\ncollege student known as the \"Lithium Bandit,\" who told\\nNewsbytes, \"I got to the mall about 6:15 and saw the group being detained\\nby approximately 5 Arlington County police and 5 security guards. When I\\nwalked over to see what was going on, a security guard asked me for an ID\\nand I refused to show it, saying that I was about to leave. The guard\\nsaid that I couldn\\'t leave and told me that I had to see a police\\nofficer. When I did, the officer demanded ID and, when I once again\\nrefused, he informed me that I could be detained for up to 10 hours\\nfor refusing to produce identification. I gave in and produced my\\nschool ID which the police gave to the security people who copied\\ndown my name and social security number.\"\\n\\nLithium Bandit continued, \"When I asked the police what was behind this\\naction, I was told that they couldn\\'t answer but that \\'the Secret\\nService is involved and we are within our rights doing this.\"\\n\\nThe boy says he and others later went to the Arlington police station\\nto get more information and were told only that there was a report\\nof the use of a stolen credit card and two officers were sent to\\ninvestigate. \"They later admitted that it was 5 [officers]. While I was\\ndetained, I heard no mention of a credit card and there was no one\\narrested.\"\\n\\nMarc Rotenberg, director of CPSR\\'s Washington office, told Newsbytes, \"I\\nhave really no details on the incident yet but I am very concerned\\nabout the reports. Confiscation of CPSR applications, if true, is\\noutrageous. I will find out more facts on Monday.\"\\n\\nNewsbytes was told by the Pentagon City Mall office that any information\\nconcerning the action would have to come from the director of security, Al\\nJohnson, who was not available until Monday. The Arlington Country\\nPolice referred Newsbytes to a \"press briefing recording\" which had not\\nbeen updated since the morning before the incident.\\n\\nCorley told Newsbytes, \"There have been no reports of misbehavior by any\\nof these people. They were obviously singled out because they were\\nhackers. It\\'s as if they were being singled out as an ethnic group. I\\nadmire the way the group responded -- in a courteous fashion. But it\\nis inexcusable that it happened. I will be at the next Washington\\nmeeting to insure that it doesn\\'t happen again.\"\\n\\nThe manager of one of New York state\\'s largest malls provided\\nbackground information to Newsbytes on the rights of malls to police those\\non mall property, saying, \"The primary purpose of a mall is to sell. The\\ninterior of the mall is private property and is subject to the\\nregulations of the mall. The only requirement is that the regulations\\nbe enforced in an even-handed manner. I do not allow political\\nactivities in my mall so I could not make an exception for Democrats.\\nWe do allow community groups to meet but they must request space at\\nleast two weeks before the meeting and must have proper insurance.\\nOur regulations also say that groups of more than 4 may not congregate\\nin the mall.\"\\n\\nThe spokeswoman added that mall security can ask for identification\\nfrom those who violate regulations and that they may be barred from the\\nmall for a period of 6 months.\\n\\nShe added, \"Some people feel that mall atriums and food courts are public\\nspace. They are not and the industry is united on this. If the malls were\\nto receive tax benefits for the common space and public service in snow\\nremoval and the like, it could possibly be a public area but malls are taxed\\non the entire space and are totally private property, subject to their own\\nregulations. If a group of 20 or more congregated in my mall, they would\\nbe asked to leave.\"\\n\\n---- article two ----\\nSubject: Secret Service Role Questioned in \"2600 Washington Raid\" 11/10/92\\nFrom: newsbytes@clarinet.com\\nDate: 10 Nov 92 21:03:23 GMT\\n\\nWASHINGTON, D.C., U.S.A., 1992 NOV 10 (NB) -- In the aftermath of an\\naction on Friday, November 6th by members of the Pentagon City Mall\\nPolice and police from Arlington County, VA in which those attending a\\n2600 meeting at the mall were ordered from the premises, conflicting\\nstories continue to appear.\\n\\nAttendees at the meeting have contended to Newsbytes that members of\\nthe mall police told them that they were \"acting on behalf of the\\nSecret Service.\" They also maintain that the mall police confiscated\\nmaterial from knapsacks and took film from someone attempting to\\nphotograph the action and a list of the names of security officers\\nthat one attendee was attempting to compile.\\n\\nAl Johnson, chief of security for the mall, denied these allegations\\nto Newsbytes, saying, \"No one said that we were acting on behalf of\\nthe Secret Service. We were merely enforcing our regulations. While\\nthe group was not disruptive, it had pulled tables together and was\\nhaving a meeting in our food court area. The food court is for\\npeople eating and is not for meetings. We therefore asked the\\npeople to leave.\"\\n\\nJohnson denied that security personnel took away any film or lists\\nand further said: \"We did not confiscate any material. The group\\nrefused to own up to who owned material on the tables and in the\\nvicinity so we collected it as lost material. If it turns out\\nthat anything did belong to any of those people, they are welcome\\nto come in and, after making proper identification, take the\\nmaterial.\"\\n\\nIn a conversation early on November 9th, Robert Rasor, Secret Service\\nagent-in-charge of computer crime investigations, told Newsbytes that\\nhaving mall security forces represent the Secret Service is not\\nsomething that was done and, that to his knowledge, the Secret\\nService had no involvement with any Pentagon City mall actions\\non the previous Friday.\\n\\nA Newsbytes call to the Arlington County police was returned by a\\nDetective Nuneville who said that her instructions were to refer all\\nquestions concerning the matter to agent David Adams of the Secret\\nService. She told Newsbytes that Adams would be providing all\\ninformation concerning the involvement of both the Arlington Police and\\nthe Secret Service in the incident.\\n\\nAdams told Newsbytes: \"The mall police were not acting as agents\\nfor the Secret Service. Beyond that, I can not confirm or deny\\nthat there is an ongoing investigation.\"\\n\\nAdams also told Newsbytes that: \"While I cannot speak for the\\nArlington police, I understand that their involvement was due to\\nan incident unrelated to the investigation.\"\\n\\nMarc Rotenberg, director of the Washington office of Computer\\nProfessionals for Social Responsibility (CPSR), told Newsbytes\\nthat \"CPSR has reason to believe that the detention of people at\\nthe Pentagon City Mall last Friday was undertaken at the behest\\nof the Secret Service, which is a federal agency.\"\\n\\n\"If that is the case, then there was an illegal search of people\\nat the mall. There was no warrant and no indication of probable\\nillegal activity. This raises constitutional issues. We have\\nundertaken the filing of a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)\\nrequest to determine the scope, involvement and purpose of the\\nSecret Service in this action,\" he said.\\n\\n2600 meetings are held on the evening of the first Friday of each\\nmonth in public places and malls in New York City, Washington,\\nPhiladelphia, Cambridge, St. Louis, Chicago, Los Angeles and San\\nFrancisco. They are promoted by \"2600 Magazine: The Hacker Quarterly\"\\nand are attended by a variety of persons interested in\\ntelecommunications and so-called \"hacker issues.\"\\n\\nThe New York meeting, the oldest of its kind, is regularly attended\\nby Eric Corley a/k/a Emmanuel Goldstein, editor and publisher of 2600,\\nhackers, journalists, corporate communications professionals and other\\ninterested parties. It is known to have been the subject of\\nsurveillance at various times by law enforcement agencies conducting\\ninvestigations into allegations of computer crime.\\n\\nCorley told Newsbytes: \"While I\\'m sure that meetings have been\\nobserved by law enforcement agencies, this is the only time that\\nwe have been harassed. It\\'s definitely a freedom of speech\\nissue.\" Corley also that he plans to be at the December meeting\\nin Washington \"to insure that it doesn\\'t happen again.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: omega@spica.bu.edu (The Omega)\\nDate: Thu, 12 Nov 92 15:34:46 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: IRC Bot\\nMessage-ID: <9211122334.AA03027@spica.bu.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nOn a related tangent, There\\'s an interesting bot on IRC\\nin the #hack room, called MACE0, whose purpose is:\\n\\n\\n>>\\nmACe0 exists primarily to accept requests for access to a secure\\nmailing list but it performs other mundane functions as well.

I want to call it the \"Rander box\" for\\nlack of a better name.\\n\\n   It will have two serial connectors,   one an input,  and other the\\noutput,   and connect to a modem or serial port.   Physically,  it should\\nhave dip switch to select baud rate,   and an on-off switch.\\n\\n   When switched on,   and a \"cr\" (or some other character) is sent to it,\\nrandom bytes will stream out continiously.   Another \"cr\" will stop the\\nbyte stream.    At least this is ONE approach.   If anyone can think of\\na better way,  Pse speak up.\\n\\n   Next week,  I plan on consulting with another hardware guru and\\nformulate an initial design.    I already know what components need\\nto go into it,   and now I want to try and eliminate an extra UART if\\nI can figure out how to turn on and off the random stream via software.\\n\\n   The internal code of PGP (I am told) uses an internal buffer to hold\\nthe random bytes,  generated my environmental changes such as key strokes,\\nmouse movements,  or other external actions.\\n\\n   Some of the Mac implementors are discussing the feasability of not\\nmaintaining 100% portability.   I suggested that we break up the PGP\\nprogram into four parts.\\n\\n  a) Incryption engine\\n  b) Key management engine.  \\n  c) GUI interface  (DOS, MacOS, UNIX, Windows,  etc) \\n  d) Random number generator (machine dependent,  possibly hardware)\\n\\n  Parts (a) and (b) are the \"portable\" parts,  and (c) and (d) are the\\nmachine dependent parts.   Because the Mac is not multi-tasking,  we can\\nget around that problem by implementing a random number generator as a\\ndriver.   Mac drivers provide for \"periodic\" code to be called as often\\nas possible,   and there are plenty of places where this driver can \"look\\nfor\" environmental changes to generate random numbers using the hashing\\nstuff that Phil implemented.    Naturally,  the IBM-PC and UNIX versions\\nof software random number generation would be different.   But as far as\\nthe Incryption and Key generators are concerned,  all they need to do,  is\\nto look into the random \"seed\" buffer.    Implementing the random number\\ngeneration as a driver also affords the possibility of having total \\nindependence of a hardware device,   and if one is desired,  no changes\\nto the code will be necessary to have one.   We just drop an appropriate\\nINIT into the system folder which will contain the appropriate driver.\\nThis is the Mac way of doing things.\\n\\n   One other problem I am having in participating in this group is the\\nextra phone expenses I will have.    I cannot get on Netcom\\'s local lines\\nfrom here anymore because they are always busy,  and there is a lot of\\nother unconsiderate people that hog up all the local lines for many hours\\nat a time,   so mail responses to and from me,  may take days.    For\\ninstance,  I cannot participate in any IRC chats unless I get local access,\\nas I am unemployed and cannot afford to call out of my area.  So please\\nexcuse any slow responses you might get from me.\\n\\nJohn D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Fri, 13 Nov 92 01:20:39 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Rander box\\nIn-Reply-To: <9211130757.AA27092@netcom2.netcom.com>\\nMessage-ID: <9211130920.AA27066@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\n>   It will have two serial connectors,   one an input,  and other the\\n>output,   and connect to a modem or serial port.

See below.\\n\\nIf you can power it off the RS-232 line, you won\\'t need a power\\nswitch.  You should be able to draw enough power off, say, the DTR\\nline to power a simple thing like this.\\n\\nFor a dedicated random number generator with low bandwidth, there\\'s\\nnot much reason for variable baud rate.  I\\'d use a fixed baud rate of,\\nsay 1200, or even 300.  If you make it low enough you could just\\nkludge together a serial interface, but with the low cost of UART\\'s,\\nit\\'s probably not worth it.  You might also consider using a PIC, which\\nhas built-in serial.\\n\\n>   When switched on,   and a \"cr\" (or some other character) is sent to it,\\n>random bytes will stream out continiously.   \\n\\nI\\'d just make the thing spew continuously.  It\\'s not like you\\'re\\nlosing real, er, information if you ignore a few random bits.  This\\nway you don\\'t need the added circuitry for switching on and off.\\n\\nThe actual use of this thing is going to require a device driver to\\nbuffer up random bits for later use.  So all the flow control to the\\nhigher layer happens there anyway.  And if the UART buffer overflows,\\nso what?\\n\\nEric\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: George A.

The\\nrandom number generator we are discussing here is not suitable for\\nmaking one-time pads.  If you want one, build it.  It\\'s not what most\\npeople need right now.\\n\\nIn fact, if one-time pads are economical to use, then surely there is\\na market for one-time pad systems.

The IBM\\nhardware design limits a machine to two ports comfortably, four\\npractical maximum. Any machine that uses telecomm. (BBSs, etc) will\\nhave to consume the serial hardware, and will interfere with whatever\\nyou have to do.\\n\\nA good choice would be a parallel port, ie. a printer port. The IBM\\ndesign allows 4 or more easily, and rarely do you see a pclone with\\nmore than two printers attached. If there isn\\'t a spare port\\navailable, Fry\\'s sells printer adapters for $19.95. Late-model printer\\nadapters are 8 bit in and out, and are capable of Ethernet speeds.\\nThe parallel port uses standard busy/done and TTL levels.\\n\\n(For a \"universal\" serial version, you could internally have the 8 bit\\nbusy/done interface drive a UART. I bet simply fixing the data rate\\nto 9600 baud would work.)\\n\\n U>    When switched on,   and a \"cr\" (or some other \\n U> character) is sent to it, random bytes will stream out \\n U> continiously.

DTR is compat\\nw/serial and parallel too.\\n\\nOn a pclone, producing bits continuously is easier. When not in use,\\nthe driver will dump bits onto the floor. Fancy (software) drivers\\ncould spool the bits into a nice big pile (\"every bit is sacred...\").\\nA simple driver could simply have say 10,000 bits, and continuously\\noverwrite the oldest (wrap around the buffer...)\\n\\n--- ReadMail\\n * Origin: tomj@fidosw.fidonet.org / World Power Systems (1:125/111)\\n--  \\nTom Jennings - via FidoNet node 1:125/555\\n    UUCP - ...!uunet!hoptoad!kumr!fidogate!111!Tom.Jennings\\nINTERNET - Tom.Jennings@f111.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: anthrax@cow.com\\nDate: Fri, 13 Nov 92 15:41:16 PST\\nTo: jordan@imsi.com\\nSubject: re: Take you off\\nMessage-ID: <9211132341.AA06610@atdt.org>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n>>\\nAre you saying that contributing to this mailing list (let alone\\n*subscribing* to it) necessarily implies that one is using the PGP\\ncode?\\n\\n\\nIf so, take me off.\\n<<\\n\\nAs a counter to that, would you or Perry necessarily imply that\\nsubscribing to a \"KrAcKeR\" magazine makes you an evil\\n\"KrAcKeR\"?\\n \\nAnyway, if you can figure out the unix commands to navigate through\\nyour mail-box, then you should have just enough intelligence\\nnot to have jumped to any short-sided conclusions like the one\\nyou proposed above.\\n \\nThen again, I could be wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: S.E.

Getting several forms of crypto out there is a good\\ninsurance policy. The problem I see is that no system, be it OTP or\\nsomething else, is likely to get much penetration in the market. PGP\\nhas taken off, but another system will face an uphill battle unless it\\nis very well-written, very easy to use, and/or fills some special\\nneed.\\n\\nStill, I want to encourage George to pursue this (somehow). I have a\\nCD-ROM on my Mac, but I doubt it\\'ll be practical to burn CD-ROMs\\neconomically (one service wants $200 for one CD-ROM, with a second one\\nfor nominally more...and note that such a service is an obvious\\nsecurity hole). 128 MB magneto-opticals may be a better bet, though\\nfew folks have them.\\n\\nIn terms of programming energy, vis-a-vis a point John Gilmore made\\nrecently about adding to the PGP effort, I\\'m sure enhancing PGP by\\nintegrating it into standard mailers (yes, I\\'m aware of the security\\nholes here, too) would be even more beneficial to cryptodiversity,\\njust in the sense of getting the volume of encrypted traffic way up. A\\ngood Mac version would also help, of course.\\n\\nAnd to head off the \"key grabbers,\" developing steganographic methods\\nto hide our encrypted bitstreams inside innocuous GIF files and the\\nlike (as I have written about before) may be useful.\\n\\n--Tim\\n\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

As the host of the\\nProgrammers Netsork,  I am experienced at setting up organizational\\ngroups,    but often these groups tend to \"fizzle out\" as people have\\nother time committments,   so it\\'s important that we try and work out\\na mechanism for \"passing the torch\" when one person has to bow out\\nfor some reason.    \\n\\n   My recommendation is to set up an FTP site where one can download the\\nlatest organizational plan,   people involved,   who is doing what,  etc,\\nand keep this info updated on a regular basis.    I don\\'t recommend that\\njust ONE person do this,   it has to be done by several people in the event\\none (or more) have to drop out for some reason.\\n\\n   In the meantime,  just be thinking about the following:\\n   \\na) Setting up a cypherpunks FTP site to contain organizational info,  latest\\n   source code,  who is doing what,   and a list of things that need to be\\ndone.\\n   \\nb) Maintaining a SOurce code control mechanism whereby people can \"check out\"\\n   code modules and work in parallel towards a common goal.\\n   \\nc) Provide periodic updates by posting important info to the rest of Cyberspace\\n   via UseNet or other on-line systems.\\n   \\n   Till next Tuesday,  take care Y\\'all....

Since I\\'m under NDA for the details of\\nOCE, I will simply quote what MacLeak says:\\n\\n According to MacWeek, Apple is using RSA software with 150-200 digit\\nprimes for Digital Signatures. They are using \"RSA\\'s RC4 algorithm [which\\nwill] provide\\n encryption of the fly for data transmitted across an OCE (open\\nCollaboratioon Environment) network.

OCE is a package to be\\ndifferentiated by its user interface, and apparently MacPGP\\'s (though I\\nhaven\\'t tried it myself yet) is rather crufty from the Mac point of view. \\nAlso, Apple traditionally wants very tight control over its source code,\\nand is unlikely to adopt something that arrives in such a (shall we say)\\n\\'informal\\' fashion from outside.\\n\\nFinally, as a dose of preventive medicine, I should mention that all of the\\nabove is my best interpretation of Apple policy and probable action, with\\nwhich I don\\'t necessarily agree personally.

Why do these major organizations spend effort on protecting,\\ninstead of just extorting? Current protection rackets maintain a monopoly and\\nmanage \"their\" resources for sustained yield. Without protection, their\\nrevenues would decline through a tragedy of the commons mechanism. Other\\nrackets would threaten the same victims, piling extortion on extortion, until\\nthe economic field is bare.\\n\\nCrypto technologies promise to liberate us from government extortion and the\\n\"protection\" of victimless crime laws by enabling the growth of a new sphere\\nof economic activity based on voluntary, secret transactions. But are these\\ntechnologies so limited in their power? \\n\\nNew opportunities in the extortion industry:\\n\\nOld problem: the victim may inform the police, making it risky to pick up the\\nmoney, which will likely be watched.\\n     New solution: demand payment via cryptomoney.\\n\\nOld problem: if you build a reputation for carrying out your threats,\\nparasitic competitors can issue threats in your name, collecting while your\\nreputation is good but destroying your reputation by not following through on\\nthreats.\\n     New solution: authenticate your threats and demands with digital\\nsignatures.\\n\\nOld problem: you may be caught firebombing the house, shooting the victim,\\nslashing the victim\\'s daughter\\'s face, or whatever; if you subcontract to a\\nthug, the thug may be caught and inform on you.\\n     New solution: use cryptomoney (and a reputation for paying) to hire thugs\\nwhile maintaining anonymity.\\n\\nOld problem: providing protection, so that you keep a supply of economically\\nviable victims from whom to extort.\\n     New solution: Please find one! If the government can\\'t protect victims\\nfrom you, how can you protect them from competitors?\\n\\n     If this analysis is correct, then crypto technologies will make extortion\\na highly profitable growth industry, making the security of property and\\npersons (outside tightly-knit walled communities?) incompatible with the\\ncontinued existence of free computer networks as we know them. Rather than\\nsuffering from a single oppressor with an incentive to keep us productive, we\\nwould become prey to an unbounded number, each competing to strip our assets\\nbefore they vanish. Society will surely suppress free networks once this\\nstarts to happen; the harder it is to suppress free networks, the greater the\\noppression will be.\\n\\nSome objections and answers:\\n\\nQ:Isn\\'t it too bleak and pessimistic to believe that the best we can do is to\\nhelp our oppressors to maintain their monopoly on oppressing us?\\nA1: The Soviet Union was established as a result of a movement that aimed to\\noverthrow an oppressive order. Millions then died under an even more\\noppressive order. This was bleak, but it happened anyway.\\nA2: Better one oppressor than many, all competing to be the first to kill and\\neat the goose, knowing that they can\\'t get the golden eggs anyway.\\nA3: Profit is a powerful motive, and conventional profitable activities are\\nimitated and expanded until demand saturates. Crypto-extortion should be\\nhighly profitable, but the \"supply\" is delivered by force, so there is no\\nproblem with competitors saturating the \"demand\" until the victims are drained\\nquite dry. This gives grounds for pessimism.\\n\\nQ: Doesn\\'t the enormous potential of this technology for expanding liberty\\noutweigh these theoretical dangers? What about our hopes and dreams, our\\nvision of a better world?\\nA: These hopes spring from a theoretical social and economic analysis of the\\nimpact of crypto technologies, and cryptomoney in particular. The above line\\nof reasoning extends the same analysis. I hope it is wrong, and would be\\ngreatly relieved to hear a convincing reason for dismissing it. If it stands,\\nthe prospect seems to be either the destruction of society by free networks,\\nor the destruction of free networks by society. The longer we can postpone\\nthis choice, the better.\\n\\nQ: Won\\'t cryptomoney be so hard to establish that there\\'s no point in worrying\\nabout this?\\nA: If so, then there is equally well no benefit in attempting to implement it.\\nThe question is, are there any conditions for \"success\" that don\\'t generate\\ndisaster? Saying the gun probably isn\\'t loaded isn\\'t an argument for putting\\nit to your head and pulling the trigger.\\n\\nQ: Isn\\'t it too late to stop these technologies?\\nA: For public key communication (secrecy and authentication), probably yes.\\nFor cryptomoney, possibly no. Most of the benefits of crypto technology seem\\nto come from the former, and most of the danger of an extortion explosion\\nseems to come from the latter.\\n\\nWishful thinking in the pursuit of liberty is no virtue; realism in the\\ndefense of imperfect liberty is no vice. Free-lance oppression isn\\'t freedom,\\nand I don\\'t want it.\\n\\nCassandra\\n9531290065272860\\n\\nP.S. Your neighbor didn\\'t pay me, and his house is ash. Will you pay me?

For example, in \"Untraceable Electronic\\nCash\", by Chaum, Fiat, and Naor, in Crypto 88, we find Alice withdrawing\\nmoney from the bank, re-blinding it, and developing a \"digital coin\", C.\\nShe then pays that to Bob, who deposits C in the bank.

I recall reading \"True Names\" a few years ago.  Vinge had\\nhis netters exchanging mail anonymously.  The hero downloaded a big\\nbatch of messages from a BBS and tried decrypting all of them to see\\nwhich were for him.  Okay, I thought, that would be a way of disguising\\nwhich messages you were _receiving_.  Then Vinge said something like\\n\"and using more elaborate techniques, the sender of a message could\\nbe hidden as well.\"  Hold on, I thought.  That will never work.  If\\nthey tap your line, they\\'re going to know exactly what messages you\\'re\\nsending.  Too bad.  Vinge had a clever idea going, but it\\'s flawed.\\n\\nI only learned about Chaum\\'s crypto stuff last year.  Somebody on the\\nExtropians list mentioned PGP, and I\\'d always had a casual interest\\nin crypto, so I downloaded it and played with it some.  I thought it\\nwas great and really got into it in a big way.\\n\\nThis got me interested in crypto in general, so I started doing some\\nlibrary research.  When I found Chaum\\'s stuff, it just blew me away.\\nThe first article I found, I think, was his CACM paper which is an\\noverview of many of the things that are possible.  I started trying to\\ntrack down other papers by Chaum.  Here were all the technologies\\nneeded to make Vinge\\'s world work, technologies which Vinge apparently\\nknew about long before I did.\\n\\nIt seemed so obvious to me.  Here we are faced with the problems of\\nloss of privacy, creeping computerization, massive databases, more\\ncentralization - and Chaum offers a completely different direction to\\ngo in, one which puts power into the hands of individuals rather than\\ngovernments and corporations.  The computer can be used as a tool to\\nliberate and protect people, rather than to control them.  Unlike the\\nworld of today, where people are more or less at the mercy of credit\\nagencies, large corporations, and governments, Chaum\\'s approach balances\\npower between individuals and organizations.  Both kinds of groups are\\nprotected against fraud and mistreatment by the other.\\n\\nNaturally, in today\\'s society, with power allocated so disproportionately,\\nsuch ideas are a threat to large organizations.  Balancing power would\\nmean a net loss of power for them.  So no institution is going to pick\\nup and champion Chaum\\'s ideas.  It\\'s going to have to be a grass-roots\\nactivity, one in which individuals first learn of how much power they\\ncan have, and then demand it.\\n\\nWhere do the remailers fit in?  They represent the \"ground floor\" of this\\nhouse of ideas - the ability to exchange messages privately, without\\nrevealing our true identities.  In this way we can engage in transactions,\\nshow credentials, and make deals, without government or corporate databases\\ntracking our every move as they can today.  Only by securing the ability to\\ncommunicate privately and anonymously can we take the next steps towards\\na world in which we each have true ownership and control over information\\nabout our lives.\\n\\nChaum\\'s ACM paper is titled, provocatively, \"Security Without Identification -\\nTransaction Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete.\"  The work we are doing\\nhere, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother\\nobsolete.  It\\'s important work.  If things work out well, we may be able\\nto look back and see that it was the most important work we have ever done.\\n\\nHal Finney\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Karl L.

But getting the basic idea usually involves reading\\nseveral articles on what RSA, digital signatures, etc., are all about,\\nworking out some examples, thinking about it, drawing pictures with\\nother folks, and finally having an \"Aha!\" experience (in Werner Erhard\\'s\\nterms, you \"get it\"). The ASCII nature of the Net is not conducive to learning\\nthis stuff, despite the excellent summaries of crypto by Marc R. and Perry M.\\n\\nThe almost-latest \"Scientific American,\" August, has an article by David Chaum\\non digital money, and the latest \"Spectrum,\" available at selected newstands,\\nhas several articles on security and cryptography. Also, there are lots of\\nbooks. Look \\'em up in a university library or flip through them at a large\\ntechnical bookstore and pick the one you like the most. (I like a slim\\nSpringer-Verlag paperback, \"Modern Cryptology,\" by Gilles Brassard, 1988, as\\na good intro to \"modern\"--as opposed to \"classical\"--crypto.)\\n\\nIf the stuff in this posting, and on crypto in general, is beyond your\\ncurrent understanding, either ignore it, skim it and try to get the gist,\\nor dig into the articles and books. \\n\\nAnyway, back to \"The Dining Cryptographers Problem: Unconditional Sender and\\nRecipient Untraceability,\" David Chaum, Journal of Cryptology, I, 1, 1988.\\nSince this journal is hard to get, I\\'ll discuss the article in some detail.\\n(The techniques have major implications for anarchocapitalism and for\\nExtropian ideas.)\\n\\nAbstract: \"Keeping confidential who sends which messages, in a world where any \\nphysical transmission can be traced to its origin, seems impossible.\\nThe solution presented here is unconditionally or cryptographically secure,\\ndepending on whether it is based on one-time-use keys or on public keys.\\nrespectively. It can be adapted to address efficiently a wide variety of \\npractical considerations.\"\\n\\nA word on terminology: \"Unconditionally secure\" means what it says: no\\ncomputer will ever crack it. One-time pads are unconditionally secure...no\\ncode or cipher is involved, except the one-time pad, so the message is\\nsecure as long as the pad has not been compromised. \"Cryptographically\\nsecure\" means secure so long as various crypto ciphers are secure, which\\nmay be for a very, very long time (e.g., with very large primes, in RSA).\\n\\nChaum describes some \"dining cryptographers,\" which I will playfully change\\nto \"dining Extropians.\" (The term is of course a variant of the seminal\\n\"dining logicians problem\" in computer science)\\n\\nThree Extropians are having dinner, perhaps in New York City. Their waiter\\ntells them that their bill has already been paid, either by the NSA\\nor by one of them. The waiter won\\'t say more.\\n\\nThe Extropians wish to know whether one of them paid, or the NSA paid. But\\nthey don\\'t want to be impolite and force the Extropina payer to \\'fess up,\\nso they carry out this protocol (or procedure):\\n\\nEach Extropian flips a fair coin behind a menu placed upright between himself\\nand the Extropian on his right. The coin is visible to himself AND to the\\nExtropian on his left. Each Extropian can see his own coin and the coin to his\\nright.\\n\\nSTOP RIGHT HERE! Please take the time to make a sketch of the situation I\\'ve\\ndescribed. If you lost it here, all that follows will be a blur. I\\'m sparing\\nyou folks my attempt at an ASCII drawing!\\n\\nEach Extropians then states out loud whether the two coins he can see are the\\nSAME or are DIFFERENT, e.g., \"Heads-Tails\" means DIFFERENT, and so forth. For\\nnow, assume the Extropians are truthful.\\n\\nA little bit of thinking shows that the total number of \"DIFFERENCES\" must\\nbe either 0 (the coins all came up the same), or 2. Odd parity is impossible.\\n\\nNow the Extropians agree that if one of them paid, he or she will SAY THE\\nOPPOSITE of what they actually see. Remember, they don\\'t announce what their\\ncoin turned up as, only whether it was the same or different as their neighbor.\\n\\nSuppose none of them paid, i.e., the NSA paid. Then they all report the truth\\nand the parity is even (either 0 or 2 differences). They then know the NSA\\npaid.\\n\\nSuppose one of them paid the bill. He reports the opposite of what he actually\\nsees, and the parity is suddenly odd. That is, there is 1 difference reported.\\nThe Extropians now know that one of them paid. But can they determine which\\none?\\n\\nSuppose you are one of the Extropians and you know you didn\\'t pay. One of the\\nother two did. You either reported SAME or DIFFERENT, based on what your \\nneighbor to the right (whose coin you can see) had. But you can\\'t tell which\\nof the other two is lying! (You can see you right-hand neighbor\\'s coin, but\\nyou can\\'t see the coin he sees to his right!)\\n\\nThis all generalizes to any number of people. If none of them paid, the parity\\nis even. If one of them paid, the parity is odd. But which one of them paid\\ncannot be deduced. And it should be clear that each round can transmit a bit,\\ne.g., \"I paid\" is a \"1\". The message \"Attack at dawn\" could thus be \"sent\"\\nuntraceably with multiple rounds of the protocol.\\n\\nThe Crypto Ouija Board: I explain this to people as a kind of ouija board.\\nA message, like \"I paid\" or a more interesting \"Transfer funds from.....,\"\\njust \"emerges\" out of the group, with no means of knowing where it came \\nfrom. Truly astounding.\\n\\nNow there are many interesting wrinkles and elaborations to this protocol. I\\'ll\\nnote just a few.\\n\\n1. Collusion. Obviously the Extropians can collude to deduce the payer. \\nThis is best dealt with by creating multiple subcircuits (groups doing the \\nprotocol amongst themselves). Lots more stuff here. Chaum devotes most of the\\npaper to these kind of issues and their solutions.\\n\\n2. With each round of this protocol, a single bit is transmitted. Sending\\na long message means many coin flips. Instead of coins and menus, the \\nneighbors would exchange lists of random numbers (with the right partners,\\nas per the protocol above, of course. Details are easy to figure out.)\\n\\n3. Since the lists are essentially one-time pads, the protocol is \\nunconditionally secure, i.e., no assumptions are made about the difficulty\\nof factoring large numbers or any other crypto assumptions.\\n\\n4. Participants in such a \"DC-Net\" (and here we are coming to the heart\\nof the \"crypto anarchy\" I have mentioned several times, and which is\\nperhaps foolishly advertised in my .sig) could exchange CD-ROMs or DATs,\\ngiving them enough \"coin flips\" for zillions of messages, all untraceable!\\nThe logistics are not simple, but one can imagine personal devices, like\\nsmart card or Apple \"Newtons,\" that can handle these protocols (early \\napplications may be for untraceable brainstorming comments, secure\\nvoting in corportate settings, etc.)\\n\\n5. The lists of random numbers (coin flips) can be generated with standard\\ncryptographic methods, requiring only a key to be exchanged between the \\nappropriate participants. This eliminates the need for the one-time pad,\\nbut means the method is now only cryptographically secure, which is \\noften sufficient. (Don\\'t think \"only cryptographically secure\" means\\ninsecure....the messages may remain encrypted for the next billion years)\\n\\n6. Collisions occur when multiple messages are sent at the same time. Various\\nschemes can be devised to handle this, like backing off when you detect\\nanother sender (when even parity is seen instead of odd parity). In large \\nsystems this is likely to be a problem. Solutions are left as an exercise.\\n\\n7. Noise. Some participants may try to flood the circuit with spurious\\nmessages, to defeat the system or for whatever other reasons. This is\\nstill an issue. (If there\\'s anything to take away from crypto, it\\'s that\\nnothing is as simple as it looks, that there are always devious ways to \\nspoof, jam, and forge. I expect you\\'ve seen this from some of the debate\\non digital voting schemes.)\\n\\nWhat Can \"DC-Net\" Be Used For?:\\n\\n* Untraceable mail. Useful for avoiding censorship, for avoiding lawsuits,\\nand for all kinds of crypto anarchy things.\\n\\n* Fully anonymous bulletin boards, with no traceability of postings or \\nresponses. Illegal materials can be offered for sale (my 1987 canonical\\nexample, which freaked out a few people: \"Stealth bomber blueprints for\\nsale. Post highest offer and include public key.\"). Think for a few minutes\\nabout this and you\\'ll see the profound implications.\\n\\n* Decentralized nexus of activity. Since messages \"emerge\" (a la the ouija\\nboard metaphor), there is no central posting area. Nothing for the government\\nto shut down, complete deniability by the participants.\\n\\n* Only you know who your a partners are....in any given circuit. And you can\\nbe in as many circuits as you wish. (Payments can be made to others,\\nto create a profit motive. I won\\'t deal with this issue, or with the issue\\nof how reputations are handled, in this posting.)\\n\\n* The tamper-responding \"digital mixes\" can still be useful, and may supplement\\nthis purely software-based approach.\\n\\n* Digital money gets involved, too, both for payments in this system, and in\\nterms of \"alternative currencies.\" I\\'m not an economist, so I\\'ll leave this \\nfor others to go into in more detail.\\n\\nEnough for now. Chaum\\'s work is just the start. These systems can initially be\\nset up for \"innocuous\" purposes like research into crypto techniques (not yet\\nbanned in the U.S.), role-playing games, religions, and the like. Once\\nthey get going, it\\'ll be too late to stop the other things.\\n\\nHope you liked this summary. Please read the articles...there\\'s just no way\\nmy posting can do justice to them (though I admit I\\'ve concentrated my efforts\\non the political aspects, which \"respectable\" crypto researchers rarely\\nmention, so perhaps the flavor here is a bit more Extropian than you\\'ll\\nfind elsewhere.)\\n\\n--Tim (part of the \"Too Many Tims!\" Conspiracy)\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

Granger\") \\n\\nA \"Viewpoint \" piece in  The Institute, November 1992\\n\\nBalancing National Interests\\n\\n  The September/October issue of The Institute carried a front page story\\nreporting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is promoting legislation\\nthat would require all telephone systems to be designed in such a way that they\\ncan be wiretapped by law enforcement officials.  The argument is that\\nwiretapping is a key tool in much of law enforcement, particularly in fields\\nsuch as drugs, racketeering, conspiracy and white collar crime, and that unless\\ncare is taken in the design of future telecommunications systems, this tool may\\nbecome difficult or impossible to exercise.  To solve this problem the FBI is\\npromoting legislation that would establish design requirements on future\\ntelephone systems.  Not surprisingly, civil liberties groups and telephone\\ncompanies are reported to be less than enthusiastic.\\n\\n        While interesting and important in its own right, this controversy is\\nperhaps even more important as a symbol of a broader set of conflicts between a\\nnumber of important national interests. As a country, we want to promote:\\n\\n  * Individual privacy (including the right of citizens and other residents of\\nthe U.S. to keep personal records private, hold private communications with\\nothers, and move about without being \"tracked\".)\\n\\n  * Security for organizations (including protection of financial transactions,\\nand the ability to keep corporate data, plans, and communications\\nconfidential.)\\n\\n  * Effective domestic law enforcement (including the ability to perform\\nsurveillance of legitimately identified suspects, and the ability to audit and\\nreconstruct fraudulent activities.)\\n\\n  * Effective international intelligence gathering (including the ability to\\nmonitor the plans and activities of organizations abroad that may pose a threat\\nto the U.S. or to other peaceful states and peoples.)\\n\\n  * Secure world-wide reliable communications for U.S. diplomats and the\\nmilitary, for U.S. business, and for U.S. citizens in their activities all\\naround the world (including the ability to maintain and gain access to secure,\\nreliable, communications channels.)\\n\\n        Just as with most of our society\\'s other fundamental objectives, these\\nobjectives are in conflict.  You can not maximize them all because getting more\\nof some involves giving up some of others.  A dynamic tension must be created\\nthat keeps the various objectives properly balanced.  That socially optimal\\npoint of balance may change gradually over time as world conditions and our\\nsociety\\'s values evolve.\\n\\n        An electrical engineer who thinks for a moment about the problem of\\nachieving any particular specified balance among the various objectives I have\\nlisted will quickly conclude that communications and information technology\\ndesign choices lie at the heart of the way in which many of the necessary\\ntradeoffs will be made.  We would like easy portable communications for all,\\nbut doing that in a way that allows people to keep their legitimate travels\\nprivate poses significant design challenges.  Banks and other businesses would\\nlike secure encrypted communications world-wide, but promoting the general\\navailability of such technologies all around the world severely complicates the\\nsignal intelligence operations of intelligence organizations.\\n\\n        The troubling thing about the FBI\\'s legislative proposals is not that\\nthey are being made, but that we lack a broader institutional context within\\nwhich to evaluate them.  In making such choices, we need to look systematically\\nat all the legitimate interests that are at stake in telecommunications and\\ninformation technology design choices, consider the ways in which technology\\nand the world are evolving, and integrate all these considerations to arrive at\\na reasoned balance.  In the old days, if things got too far out of line in some\\nbalance (for example, between freedom of the press and protection against\\nliable), the courts simply readjusted things and we went on.  Today, and\\nincreasingly in the future, with many of these balances hard wired into the\\nbasic design of our information and communication systems, it may be much\\nharder to readjust the balance after the fact.\\n\\n        There are several organizations that should be working harder on these\\nissues.  On the government side the Telecommunication and Computing\\nTechnologies Program in the Office of Technology Assessment should be doing\\nmore systematic studies of these tradeoffs to help inform the Congress; The\\nNational Telecommunications and Information Administration in the Department of\\nCommerce (or some appropriate interagency committee) should be doing similar\\nstudies to develop more coherent and comprehensive executive branch policy; and\\nthe Office of Policy and Plans in the Federal Communications Commission (which\\nis an independent regulatory agency not directly subject to executive branch\\npolicy) should be giving these issues more attention so it can better support\\nthe Commissioners when they confront such tradeoffs.  On the non-government\\nside, the Office of Computer and Information Technology at the National\\nResearch Council might appropriately mount a comprehensive study.  There is an\\nideal opportunity here for a private foundation to fund an independent\\nblue-ribbon commission.  Finally, the computer and telecommunications\\nindustries, both individually and collectively through their industry\\nassociations, should be taking more interest in how the country will strike\\nthese all important balances.\\n                                                        M.

Therefore the Third Meeting will be\\ndevoted to project planning and design review.\\n\\n\\nDate: November 21\\nTime: 12 noon\\nWhere: Cygnus Support offices\\nWho: you, and anybody you know who wants to come, and so on.  (Please\\n    do not post this announcements to public places, but do encourage\\n    private circulation.)\\nPositive-Confimation:  Please tell me if you are coming.  Replies to\\n    hughes@soda.berkeley.edu.\\n\\n\\nPlease, I urge all of you on the list that can make to attend this\\ntime.  This will be a pivotal meeting, since we are deciding\\npriorities here.  If you want to affect the course of development, you\\nought to show up.  If you can\\'t attend, corner someone on the list who\\nwill be there and convince them to represent your position.\\n\\nEric Hughes\\n\\n\\n\\nAGENDA\\n======\\n\\n1.  Key exchange.  Bring a diskette with your PGP public key on it.\\nBring a machine which can read this diskette.  Bring extra diskettes\\nto collect keys on and to give out.  Let us not be hypocrites and let\\nus all know each other\\'s public keys.\\n\\n2.  Project planning.  We need a list of crypto projects and who is\\nworking on them.  This will help coordination and avoid duplication of\\neffort.  We need to prioritize the projects to avoid premature\\ndevelopment.  We need to create strategies and design criteria.\\n\\n3.  Project logistics.  We need to talk about the best ways to do\\nwidely distributed software development in this fairly anarchic\\nenvironment.\\n\\n4.  Design review.  Hal Finney and I have been duking it out behind\\nthe scenes working on a design schema for the next generation\\nremailer.  I\\'d like to present the design and have people critique it.\\n\\n(would be 5.) We won\\'t be playing the crypto-anarchy game this time.\\nIt\\'s not a dead duck, but this time we\\'ve got more urgent things to\\ndo.\\n\\n\\nDIRECTIONS\\n==========\\n\\nHere is a reposting of the directions to the meeting place. \\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Better directions to the meeting on Saturday at noon\\nFrom: gnu@cygnus.com\\n\\nSomeone asked for better directions, and the original ones were\\npretty skimpy anyway.  Here\\'s a better try.\\n\\n\\tCygnus Support\\n\\t1937 Landings Drive\\n\\tMt. View, CA  94043\\n\\nThere\\'s no phone service there yet.\\n\\nTake US 101 toward Mt. View.  From San Francisco, it\\'s about a\\n40-minute drive.  Get off at the Rengstorff Ave/Amphitheatre Parkway\\nexit.  If you were heading south on 101, you curve around to the\\nright, cross over the freeway, and get to a stoplight.  If you were\\nheading north on 101, you just come right off the exit to the\\nstoplight.  The light is the intersection of Amphitheatre and\\nCharleston Rd.  Take a right on Charleston; there\\'s a right-turn-only\\nlane.\\n\\nFollow Charleston for a short distance.  You\\'ll pass the\\nMetaphor/Kaleida buildings on the right.  At a clump of palm trees and\\na \"Landmark Deli\" sign, you can take a right into Landings Drive; this\\ngets you into the complex from the north.  Or you can go slightly\\nfurther along Charleston and take the next right, into a driveway with\\na big \"Landmark\" sign in the middle.  No matter which way you got into\\nthe complex, follow around it until you are on the side that faces the\\nfreeway.  There\\'s a clock tower that rises out of one of the\\nbuildings, to the right (south) of the deli.  Enter through the doors\\nimmediately under the clock tower.  They\\'ll be open between noon and\\n1PM at least.  (See below if you\\'re late.)\\n\\nOnce inside, take the stairs up, immediately to your right.  At the top\\nof the stairs, turn right past the treetops, and we\\'ll be in 1937 on \\nyour left.\\n\\nIf you are late and the door under the clock tower is locked, you can\\ngo to the deli (which will be around a building and left, as you face\\nthe door), cut between the buildings to the right of the deli, and\\ninto the back lawns between the complex and the farm behind it.  Walk\\naround the buildings until you see a satellite dish in the lawn.  Go\\nup the stairs next to the dish, which are the back stairs into the\\nCygnus office space.  We\\'ll prop the door (or you can bang on it if we\\nforget).\\n\\nOr, you can find the guard who\\'s wandering around the complex, who\\nknows there\\'s a meeting happening and will let you in.  They can be\\nbeeped at 965 5250, though you\\'ll have trouble finding a phone.\\n\\nDon\\'t forget to eat first, or bring food at noon!  I recommend hitting\\nthe burrito place on Rengstorff (La Costen~a) at about 11:45.  To get\\nthere, when you get off 101, take Rengstorff (toward the hills) rather\\nthan Amphitheatre (toward the bay).  Follow it about ten blocks until\\nthe major intersection at Middlefield Road.  La Costen~a is the store\\non your left at the corner.  You can turn left into the narrow lane\\nbehind the store, which leads to a parking lot, and enter by the front\\ndoor, which faces the intersection.  To get to the meeting from there,\\njust retrace your route on Rengstorff, go straight over the freeway,\\nand turn right at the stoplight onto Charleston; see above.\\n\\nSee you there!\\n\\n\\tJohn Gilmore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hollander <hh@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Mon, 16 Nov 92 10:44:37 PST\\nTo: \"George A.

The server and user would each have key pairs (probably a new pair\\nfor each session), and would trade public keys.  The user would request a\\nport from the server, and then would issue (encrypted) commands to the\\nserver.\\n\\nThese commands might include:\\n\\ntelnet - open a connection to the target.  The target would route its\\npackets to the server, and the server would encrypt them and route them to\\nthe user.\\n\\nignore - get ready to recieve lots of random bits and perhaps pass them on to\\nother servers.  This is needed to help a user confuse trafic analysis.  A\\nside note:  it would be useful to have a standard port on all machines that\\nwould accept the encrypted ignore command, so that packets could just be\\nsent off into the ether.  Users who use bouncers would want to have their\\nmachines open up connections, issue the ignore command, and send random bits\\nat some random interval.\\n\\nmail - act as an anonymous remailer (like the ones we already have set up).\\n\\nport - provide a port that other people can telnet in to.\\n\\nThis type of anonymous bouncer would be helpful for everything we do with\\nTCP, including perhaps mail.\\n\\ne\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tom.jennings@f111.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG (tom jennings)\\nDate: Mon, 16 Nov 92 20:52:02 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: ECPA - PRIVACY\\nMessage-ID: <3759.2B0852B9@fidogate.FIDONET.ORG>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nCrossposted from FidoNet PUBLIC_KEYS\\n\\nfrom: GK Pace\\nto: Mike Riddle\\n\\n  I just finished reading your article concerning the \"laymans view\"\\nof the ECPA.  I found it very informative, and interesting reading.\\nThank you for taking the time to study this issue, and share with the\\nrest of us the conclusions you arrived at, upon doing so.\\n\\n  I would like to comment upon some of what you\\'ve written, in hopes\\nof expanding upon what you have conveyed, and have quoted your article\\nso that those who haven\\'t read your article will find it easier to\\nunderstand the nature of my comments.\\n\\n ========== Begin Quote ==========\\n Anytime someone passes what they hope to be a private communication to\\nanother, they expect that their fellow citizens will respect its privacy.\\nNot only do the customs of society enforce this expectation, statute laws\\nhave been enacted to insure it.  Thus, everyone knows, or should know, not\\nto tamper with the mail.  Everyone knows, or should know, not to\\nelectronically eavesdrop (\"bug\") someone else\\'s telephone calls.  And\\neveryone knows, or should know, not to do likewise with computer\\ncommunications.\\n\\nAlas, not everyone knows that.  If everyone did, we wouldn\\'t need laws to\\nprotect what ought to be our reasonable expectations of privacy.  Not too\\nlong ago, the Congress of the United States passed PL 99-508, the Electronic\\nCommunications Privacy Act of 1986.  In doing so, Congress was recognizing\\nthe way technology has changed society and trying to react to that change.\\n ========== End Quote ==========\\n\\n  This statement kinda sums up what the discussion is all about... and\\nties this subject into the provisions of the ECPA. seems like a\\nfitting beginning for the remainder of what I\\'d like to discuss.\\n\\n ========== Begin Quote ==========\\nWhat about electronic mail, or \"e-mail?\"  E-Mail has been the single biggest\\narea of misinformation about the new law.  First, section 2701 does make it\\na federal offense to read someone else\\'s electronic mail.  That would be\\nexceeding your authorization, since \"private\" e-mail systems do not intend\\nfor anyone other than the sender or receiver to see that mail.  But, and a\\nbig but, sysops are excluded.\\n ========== End Quote ==========\\n\\n  This statement in and of itself lends credibility to the position\\nthat we have the right to read any messages passing thru our system...\\nhowever as you continue to mention, this exclusion is not without\\nconditions, and it isn\\'t necessarily a \"right\" but is perhaps more\\naccurately defined as an acknowledgement of the technical aspects of\\nour respective systems, and the part we play in accomodating the\\ntransfer of E-mail...\\n\\n ========== Begin Quote ==========\\n Whoever staffed the bill for Congress realized that system operators were \\ngoing to have access to information stored on their systems.\\n ========== End Quote ==========\\n\\n  You also of course mention reasons for which this ability might be\\ndesired:\\n\\n ========== Begin Quote ==========\\n There are practical technical reasons for this, but there are also practical \\nlegal reasons.  While the Act does not directly address the liability of\\nsysops \\nfor the use of their systems in illegal acts, it recognizes they might have \\nsome liability, and so allows them to protect themselves from illegal use.\\n ========== End Quote ==========\\n\\n  This statement reeks of common sense... but is there anything in the\\nECPA which would indicate a \"responsibility\" on the part of the Sysop\\nto actively monitor such communications, requiring the Sysop to assume\\nthe position of censor, police, and/or judge, over the content of\\nthose messages passing thru ones system - or does it again acknowledge\\nthe techical aspects, and responsibilities the Sysop might be required\\nto exercise in the event the Sysop were to become aware of a message\\ncontaining potentially illegal information? \\n\\n ========== Begin Quote ==========\\n  Sysops are given a special responsibility to go along with this special \\nprivilege.  Just like a letter carrier can\\'t give your mail to someone else, \\njust like a telegraph operator can\\'t pass your telegram to someone else, just \\nlike a telephone operator overhearing your call can\\'t tell someone else what\\nit \\nwas about, so sysops are prohibited from disclosing your e-mail traffic to \\nanyone, unless you (or the other party to the traffic) give them permission.\\n ========== End Quote ==========\\n\\n  This analysis is again just plain common sense, and again the\\nquestion arises, are the provisions this refers to those which are\\nacknowledged as technical limitations, accomodating them as such, or\\nare they to be construed as indications that we have obligations above\\nand beyond that which is necessary for the performance of the service\\nwe are providing?\\n\\n ========== Begin Quote ==========\\nWhat all this has said is that the federal criminal code now protects\\nelectronic communications the way it previously protected written ones.  It\\nunderstands that mailmen, physical or electronic, have access to the mail\\nthey carry, so it tells them not to tell.\\n ========== End Quote ==========\\n\\n  This statement seems clear enough... but when viewed from the aspect\\nof the issue of wheather \"private\" E-mail should be allowed in\\nFidonet, it gives rise to some questions which can possibly be best\\nconveyed by following the analog you have chosen... i/e that of a\\nmailman, and that of \"paper mail\".\\n\\n  The issue of the Sysop having the ability to read e-mail, as\\ncompared to the provisions of the ECPA appear to be more closely\\ncomparable to \"postcards\" being carried by a mailman.  In this case,\\nno one could deny that the mailman has a \"technical\" ability to read\\nthe postcards being carried, and that the requirements on the part of\\nthe mailman not to divulge such information he/she might happen to\\nnotice is clear... as are the responsibilities that would be evident\\nwere he/she to become aware of information which could resonably be\\ncontrued as illegal in nature.  But as in the example of the mailman\\nhandling paper mail, there exists the ability to send \"private\" paper\\nmail, which is enclosed in an envelope.  In such cases is is not\\nwithin the rights of the mailman to open such mail to enable his\\nability to determine the contents thereof, nor is there any legal\\nresponsibility for the mailman to have knowledge of the contents\\nthereof.  Indeed it would be a criminal act were the mailman to do so.\\n\\n  With the above in mind, wouldn\\'t the introduction of private e-mail\\ncapabilities in Fidonet be governed by the same logic?  And isn\\'t\\npublic key encryption simply the means of wrapping an envelope around\\ne-mail to make it private?\\n\\n\\n                               -gk\\n\\n--- GenMsg vers:1.14/a\\n * Origin: Privacy... everyone needs it, Lets Route it thru FidoNet (1:374/26)\\nSEEN-BY: 11/2 13/13 101/1 109/25 114/5 123/19 124/1 125/20 28 33 40 111 125\\nSEEN-BY: 125/180 1212 203/1 23 205/10 209/209 280/1 390/1 396/1\\n;;PATH: 374/26 12 1 151/1003 13/13 396/1 203/23 125/125 33\\n\\n\\n--  \\ntom jennings - via FidoNet node 1:125/555\\n    UUCP - ...!uunet!hoptoad!kumr!fidogate!111!tom.jennings\\nINTERNET - tom.jennings@f111.n125.z1.FIDONET.ORG\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tribble@xanadu.com (E.

It would have measured about a\\nfoot wide by 10\" long by about 2-3\" thick, had an LCD for about six to eight\\nlines of text at a time, two 3-1/2\" FDDs, a pair of sockets for \"Codepacks\"\\n(hardware key storage devices which would have been tamper-resistant and\\npassword protected), a good quality keyboard, a modem with modular jack and\\noptional acoustic couplers (for payphones: low-tech anonymity)... the\\nTempest feature would have been achieved by putting 100dB of white noise on\\nthe metal housing, which would have been imperfect but decent enough.  There\\nwas no plan for a hard drive; the operating software would have been a\\nsimple line editor and the crypto routines, all burned into ROM and part of\\nthe main processor board.  No plans for thermite linings at the time either,\\nthough we did have a password routine with a duress option, which would have\\nerased anything on the FDDs or the Codepacks.  \\n\\nMy first intended market for this thing was the political dissident\\ncommunity, where communication has always suffered to a small but noticeable\\ndegree by the \"we can\\'t talk on the phone\" factor.

My previous\\nmessage contains my public key,   Pse use it if you want to send me \\nprivate mail.\\n\\n   I bet the NSA boys are tearing the hair out of their heads by\\nnow,   but it\\'s about time we do something to preserve our privacy.\\n\\n   It is my plan to help \"organize\" the Mac implementation of PGP,\\nby putting together a Mac Implementation team of programmers to \\nbeef up MacPGP,  by added better GUI,  such as cutting and pasting\\nof keys DIRECTLY into key rings without having to go through a\\nfile (makes for added security).\\n\\n   My plans also call for tight coordination with the other platform\\ndevelopment teams.   \\n\\n   I\\'ve been getting good support for my ideas on implementing machine\\nindependent modules or \"Libraries\" of PGP routines that don\\'t include\\nI/O portions,   but after looking at the code,   I see this is going to\\ntake a lot of work,   both in organizing the effort,   and in implementing\\nthe code.    Just how this is going to be done,  I\\'m not sure,   but this\\nis what cypherpunks is all about.    To hash these things over,  flame on\\neach other\\'s ideas,  etc.\\n\\n   So far,  the Mac inplementaion team consists of the following individuals,\\nand are (or soon will be) working closly with Eric Hughs,  Phil Zimmerman,\\nand the other PGP folks\\n\\nMac PGP team:\\n\\n  Richard Outerbridge [71755.204]\\n  Jim Clausing internet: jac@cis.ohio-state.edu\\n  Zbigniew Fiedorowicz internet: fiedorow@function.mps.ohio-state.edu\\n  INTERNET:crunch@netcom.com INTERNET:crunch@netcom.com\\n  Doug McNaught internet: doug@midget.towson.edu\\n  Philip Zimmermann internet: prz@sage.cgd.ucar.edu\\n  \\n  I talked with another individual last evening who also wants to be added\\nto the team,   but the others haven\\'t yet been introduced to him yet.\\n\\n  It is my plan to propose this idea to the PGP meeting at Sygnus this\\nupcoming Saturday at noon.   Then,   I\\'ll report to those that couldn\\'t\\nmake it,  due to their location.    \\n\\n  The progress on the Rander box is as follows:    I am currently evaluating\\nseveral proposed designs,  and have sent out queries for data sheets on\\ndevices I plan on checking out for use,  prices,  etc.\\n\\n  I have been studying the PGP code,   and can see it\\'s going to take a\\nlot of work to get it into a form where true machine portability can\\nbe realized.   As  a Mac purist,  a abhore the idea if translating Mac\\nGUI actions into ascii text and sending it to the current PGP \"engine\".\\n\\n  Although it would take a lot of work,   I propose that we develop PGP\\nto have the following form.\\n\\n  a) Encryption engine library - Main set of routines currently in the\\n     PGP program dealing with encryption of data.   These would be\\n     a set of \"support\" routines that would permit encryption of\\n     data in files,  as well as data in memory.   These would be\\n     totally machine independent,  and only ONE set of sources should\\n     exist and contain compiler options for platform specific code.\\n     These functions would then return error codes instead of console\\n     output.   Needed \"key phrases\" can be passed in as \"char *\",\\n     and sucessful operations would return NULL or if error,  an\\n     appropriate code be returned.  Other routines would be necessary,\\n     such as telling it where the random ring buffer is located,  and\\n     how long it is.   These routines would maintain their own\\n     pointers into this buffer.   This library would call routines\\n     in the Random number manager and pass information such as where\\n     the buffer is located.   See below:\\n     \\n  b) Key management library - Main set of routines that know how to \\n     manage the keyring files,  it would have functions designed to\\n     extract keys,  add and remove them,  and work on the keyring\\n     files directly.   Again,  these would be machine independent\\n     routines.   This would also call routines in the Random number\\n     manager below.\\n     \\n  c) Random number management - Main set of routines to manage a\\n     \"circular buffer\" of random numbers used to generate keys.  This\\n     would work with both software and hardware random number generators,\\n     and would provide externally machine independent functions,  but\\n     internally they would be machine specific.\\n     \\n  d) GUI\\'s for the various PGP application programs.   Mail management,\\n     file management,  network applications,  etc,  all calling the\\n     routines in a,b, and  c.   Also includes Hypercard Xcmds,  etc.\\n     \\n  Items a and b should have only ONE set of source code,  and be \\nmaintained and managed by existing people.    Items c would also\\nbe same source code,   but have conditional compiler statements \\nto \"switch in\" the machine dependent portions as apppropriate.\\n\\n  I think it\\'s possible to design the code in a and b to have very few\\nmachine dependent conditional compiler #ifdef statements,  by forming\\nthe main PGP guts portion to operate on textual input in the form\\nof \"char *\" instead of console input,  and let the calling code\\npass \"char *\" to PGP library routines.\\n\\n  Machine dependent stuff is in (d) and might include existing UNIX\\nPGP \"main()\",  Mac PGP main application,  and lower level \"utilities\"\\nsuch as Hypercar XCMD\\'s etc.    In fact,  it is even possible to \\nbuild these libraries to use NO global variables,  and use structures\\ninstead.    But me,  being Mac biased,  will probably get a lot of\\nresistance to this proposal,  but it is just that,  a PROPOSAL.\\n\\n  At any rate,   I think that portability issues would be better solved\\nif we were to adopt C code portability and to assume that not ALL\\nplatforms work well with console type input,  and that Console\\nI/O should be \"factored out\" of the machine independent portions of the\\nexisting PGP code.\\n\\n  So,  what way folks,  has anyone got a better idea or proposal?\\n  \\nCheers\\nJD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: wmo@rebma.rebma.mn.org (Bill O\\'Hanlon)\\nDate: Thu, 19 Nov 92 19:43:57 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Another remailer\\nMessage-ID: <m0msP7R-0006QgC@rebma.rebma.mn.org>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve installed Eric\\'s anonymous remailer scripts at remailer@rebma.mn.org.\\nRebma is my home machine...

Re the latter, this isn\\'t the same thing as blind\\n\\nI doubt this\\'ll work. You\\'re welcome to try, though. \\n\\nWe had this same discussion in a nanotech group I attend (Ted\\nKaehler\\'s \"Assembler Multitude,\" in Palo Alto), where the concern was\\nabout the \"grey goo\" that could result from replicator development.\\nSeveral folks recommended that the best approach to handling malicious\\n\"nanotech hacking\" is _education_, just as George is recommending for\\nwhat might be called \"malicious crypto.\"\\n\\nThe problems are:\\n\\n1. Moral education (= Christian, in the West) has been tried for\\ncenturies, with little apparent effect on murders, rapes, war, and\\npillage. I won\\'t knock religion here, but the teachings don\\'t seem to\\nhave much of an effect.\\n\\n2. There\\'s usually some fringe, which may be 10% or which may be 1%,\\nwhich does the _opposite_ of the mainstream teachings. For example,\\nlet us suppose George successfully organizes the \"Young Men\\'s Crypto\\nAssociation,\" or YMCA, to go out to high schools and shopping malls to\\npreach the virtues of crypto temperance, of the evils of computer\\nviruses (a parallel to the crypto stuff talked about here, and an even\\nbetter example of \"hacker morality\"), etc.\\n\\nThis YMCA will perhaps teach some set of values to perhaps 90% or even\\n99% of the hacker community it preaches to. But what of the rest? A\\ncase can be made that such preaching will _energize_ this minority\\ninto action, if only to poke a stick into the eye of society.\\n\\n3. Practically speaking, how can a handful of we crypto enthusiasts\\neven begin to compete with the teachings of other moralists and\\nreligious types? We\\'ve got other fish to fry.\\n\\n4. Finally, many of the \"crypto anarchy\" views I\\'ve been espousing for\\nseveral years now have been seen by some as grossly immoral and\\ndangerous. Should the YMCA (the Young Men\\'s Crypto Association,\\nremember) argue _against_ such ideas? \\n\\n\\n> obedience, but rather the idea that if there is to be disobedience it needs\\n> to be grounded in deeply held personal ethics, as for example in the case of\\n> civil disobedience.

I don\\'t know how to address\\n> that problem except to note that such individuals are hardly stopped today\\n> by the threat of prosecution.  \\n\\nI agree with George that some will always \"wreck for thrills.\" What\\ncrypto and privacy techniques do is give us some protection against\\nthese vandals. Like locks on doors, or sealed envelopes, these\\ntechniques protect us a lot better than moral lectures against\\nthievery or fraud.\\n\\nHaving said all this, if George decides to go ahead with his version\\nof the YMCA, maybe I\\'ll even stand outside in the cold and ring a bell.\\n\\n--Tim\\n\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

It is possible to sign certificates such\\nthat they are untracable to their owner, exactly like crypto money.\\nA security concern here is that the mix owner can tell when the\\nsame user uses the mix more than once (but the owner can\\'t tell\\nwhich user).\\n\\n- Charge for the mix services with crypto-money.  The crypto-money\\ncould be some networking service.  It could be even mix transmission.\\nFor example, the basic currency could be the transmission of 10K\\nthrough a mix.  One would have to create a mix and let the bank\\nroute some traffic through it thereby putting credits in your\\naccount.  Once you have credits, you could spend them anywhere.\\nOne might want to fiddle with the definition of the currency so\\nthat it does not depreciate with time.\\n\\nI prefer the second option.  I think mixes and crypto-money really\\ngo hand in hand.\\n-- \\n\\tMiron Cuperman <miron@extropia.wimsey.com>   | NeXTmail/mime ok\\n\\t\\t       <miron@cs.sfu.ca>\\t     | Public key avail\\n\\tAMIX: MCuperman\\t\\t\\t\\t     |\\nimmortalcybercomputinglaissezfaire\\t\\t     |\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: pmetzger@shearson.com (Perry E.

Introduction\\n\\nIn the Internet community, an electronic mail message has two parts: the headers and the body. The headers form a collection of field/value pairs structured according to RFC 822 [1], whilst the body, if structured, is defined according to Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) [2]. \\n\\nPrivacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) [3-6] allows encryption and authentication services to be applied to an electronic mail message.\\n\\nThis memo defines a framework whereby the services provided by MIME and PEM are used in a complementary fashion. \\n\\nIn order to provide for MIME-PEM interaction, two content types, \"multipart/pem\" and \"application/pem\", are defined. Then, the relationship between MIME and PEM is described in terms of two functions: message composition and message delivery.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpires May 16, 1993\\t[Page 2]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndraft\\tMIME-PEM Interaction\\tNov 92\\n\\n\\n4. Definiton of new Content Types\\n\\n\\n4.1. Definition of the multipart/pem Content Type \\n\\n(1) MIME type name: multipart\\n\\n(2) MIME subtype name: pem\\n\\n(3) Required parameters: boundary, privacy \\n\\n(4) Optional parameters: none\\n\\n(5) Encoding considerations: always 7bit \\n\\n(6) Security Considerations: see [3]\\n\\n\\nThis subtype of multipart always contains two body parts: the first is an arbitrary content; and, the second is an application/pem content which describes the privacy- enhancements which resulted in the first body part. \\n\\nThe value of the first body part corresponds to <pemtext> as defined in [3]. Note that if <pemtext> is represented using the base64 encoding, then a a Content-Transfer-Encoding: header is present which indicates use of the base64 content encoding. Otherwise, if a Content-Transfer-Encoding: header is present, it indicates use of the 7bit content encoding. \\n\\nThe syntax and semantics of the boundary parameter is defined in [2].\\n\\nThe syntax of the privacy parameter, using the ABNF notation of [1], is:\\n\\nprivacy-value ::= \"ENCRYPTED\"\\n/ \"MIC-ONLY\"\\n/ \"MIC-CLEAR\"\\n\\nwith each value conveying the intent as specified in [3]. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpires May 16, 1993\\t[Page 3]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndraft\\tMIME-PEM Interaction\\tNov 92\\n\\n\\n4.2. Definition of the application/pem Content Type \\n\\n(1) MIME type name: application\\n\\n(2) MIME subtype name: pem\\n\\n(3) Required parameters: none\\n\\n(4) Optional parameters: none\\n\\n(5) Encoding considerations: always 7bit \\n\\n(6) Security Considerations: see [3]\\n\\n\\nThe syntax of this content type corresponds to the <pemhdr> production defined in [3].\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpires May 16, 1993\\t[Page 4]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndraft\\tMIME-PEM Interaction\\tNov 92\\n\\n\\n5. Message Composition\\n\\nWhen a user composes a message, it is the responsibility of the user agent to use the Content-Type: header. This allows the receiving user agent to unambiguously interpret the body and process it accordingly.\\n\\nThis memo introduces a new header field, \"Content-Privacy\", which is used to indicate that the message should undergo privacy-enhancement prior to submission. The syntax of this header field corresponds to the <privacy-value> production defined above.\\n\\n\\n5.1. Pre-Submission Algorithm\\n\\nPrior to submission, the user agent applies this algorithm: \\n\\n(1) If the content does not contain the Content-Privacy: \\nheader, then the user agent sees if the content is either multipart or message. If so, it then recursively applies this algorithm to the encapsulated body parts; if not, it terminates processing for this content.\\n\\n(2) If the content does contain the Content-Privacy: header, \\nthe content is transformed from local form to its canonical form. Note that if a Content-Transfer- Encoding: header is present, then the content encoding is reversed as a part of this process.\\n\\n(3) If the canonical form of the content uses octet values \\noutside of the NVT ASCII repertoire, and if the value of the Content-Privacy: header is MIC-CLEAR, then this inconsistency is reported to the user and the algorithm aborts.\\n\\n(4) Otherwise, the privacy-enhancement indicated by the \\nContent-Privacy: header is performed, constructing a new content. The Content- headers, other than Content- Transfer-Encoding: and Content-Privacy:, are taken from the original content, if any.\\n\\n(5) If the value of the Content-Privacy: header is not MIC- \\nCLEAR, then the base64 content encoding is applied and a Content-Transfer-Encoding: header is added to the new \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpires May 16, 1993\\t[Page 5]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndraft\\tMIME-PEM Interaction\\tNov 92\\n\\n\\ncontent.\\n\\n(6) Finally, a multipart/pem content is constructed, whcih \\ncontains the new content and a corresponding application/pem content. The multipart/pem content replaces the original content.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpires May 16, 1993\\t[Page 6]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndraft\\tMIME-PEM Interaction\\tNov 92\\n\\n\\n6. Message Delivery\\n\\nWhen a user receives a message containing an multipart/pem content, the user agent may transform the content back into its original content type. This operation, the post-delivery algorithm, is performed by reversing the steps performed during the pre-submission algorithm.\\n\\nWhen the original content is reconstituted into canonical form, it may use octet values outside of the NVT ASCII repertoire. If the user agent replaces the multipart/pem content with the original content, then it must select an appropriate transfer encoding and include the appropriate Content-Transfer-Encoding: header.\\n\\n\\nUpon successful completion of the post-delivery algorithm for each content, the user agent adds a new header field, \"Content-Annotation\", which is used to indicate the privacy- enhancements that were in effect when the content was submitted. The syntax of this header field, using the ABNF notation of [1], is:\\n\\ncontent-annotation ::= \"Content-Annotation\" \":\" \\nannotation-value\\n\\nannotation-value ::= <privacy-value> \";\" <date-time> \\n\\nwith <privacy-value> corresponding to the privacy-enhancements that was in effect during submission, and <date-time>, defined in [1], indicates the date and time that the privacy- enhancements were verified by the receiving user agent. \\n\\nNOTE\\nIt must be strongly emphasized that the user\\'s level of trust in the value of the Content-Annotation: header should be no higher than the user\\'s level of trust in the message store employed by the user agent. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExpires May 16, 1993\\t[Page 7]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ndraft\\tMIME-PEM Interaction\\tNov 92\\n\\n\\n7. An Example\\n\\nFor example, suppose the following message was being readied for submission:\\n\\nDate: Thu, 12 Nov 1992 21:43:40 -0800\\nFrom: scrocker@tis.com\\nTo:\\tned@innosoft.com\\nSubject: example #1\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii Content-Privacy: mic-clear\\n\\nHi Ned.

Observations\\n\\nThe use of the pre-submission and post-delivery algorithms exhibit several properties:\\n\\n(1) It allows privacy-enhancement of an arbitrary content, \\nnot just an RFC 822 message.\\n\\n(2) For a multipart or message content, it allows the user to \\ndecide whether the structure of the content should receive privacy-enhancement.\\n\\n(3) It allows a message to contain several privacy enhanced \\ncontents, thereby removing the requirement for PEM software to be able to generate or interpret a single content which intermixes both unenhanced and enhanced components.\\n\\n(4) It minimizes confusion when viewing a MIC-CLEAR content \\nwithout a PEM-capable user agent.\\n\\n(5) It minimizes confusing when viewing a MIC-ONLY content \\nwith a MIME-capable user agent that is not PEM-capable. \\n\\n\\n9.

Let me add\\na short bit of history here.  MIME came about because of an effort\\nwithin the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) to extend Internet\\nmail standards to support 8-bit extended character sets and (gasp) to\\npotentially even support the sending of arbitrary binary data.  A\\nworking group was formed and it took several months and literally\\nthousands of messages before some form of consensus was reached on the\\ntechnical issues (note -- not the solution, just the issues!).\\n\\nTo make a long story short, it quickly became obvious that there was\\nno agreed upon solution which would both provide the functionality the\\nvarious camps wanted, and backwards compatability for the million or\\nso hosts currently on the Internet.  The MIME effort was a creative\\nstroke of genius which allowed us to get out of this fix.  Simply put,\\nit allows for a) arbitrary data types to be encoded into 7-bit ASCII\\nand transported using standard RFC-821 SMTP, and b) the structuring of\\nchunks of different data type \"parts\" into a single e-mail message\\nsuch that MIME-aware mail-agents/readers can intelligently display\\nmulti-media mail intelligently.  In other words, the problem was moved\\nfrom the protocol space to the applications space.\\n\\nWhy is this relevant?  Well, in order for MIME to be useful, the mail\\nreaders that people use have to be modified to support MIME.\\nFortunately, Nathaniel Borenstein of Bellcore has assembled a kit to\\nmake this much easier, and in fact provides patches for many mailers.\\nNow, the authors of all the freebie mail readers we use are being\\nasked to incorporate these changes into their mailers.  Do we really\\nwant to give them an additional burden -- or do we want to leverage\\noff work that is already being done?\\n\\n-Ittai\\n\\nPS:  For those who are interested, these are the relevant RFC\\'s:\\n\\n1344  Implications of MIME for Internet mail gateways.

Channels may be secure or insecure, and may \\nhave eavesdroppers (or enemies, or disrupters, etc.) who alter \\nmessages, insert and delete messages, etc. Cryptography is \\nthe means by which communications over insecure channels \\nare protected.\\n\\n***\\tchosen plaintext attack -- an attack where the \\ncryptanalyst gets to choose the plaintext to be enciphered, \\ne.g., when possession of an enciphering machine or algorithm \\nis in the possession of the cryptanalyst.\\n\\n***\\tcipher -- a secret form of writing, using substitution or \\ntransposition of characters or symbols.\\n\\n***\\tciphertext -- the plaintext after it has been encrypted.\\n\\n***\\tcode -- a restricted cryptosystem where words or \\nletters of a message are replaced by other words chosen from \\na codebook. Not part of modern cryptology, but still useful.\\n\\n***\\tcoin flipping -- an important crypto primitive, or \\nprotocol, in which the equivalent of flipping a fair coin is \\npossible. Implemented with blobs.\\n\\n***\\tcollusion -- wherein several participants cooperate to \\ndeduce the identity of a sender or receiver, or to break a \\ncipher. Most cryptosystems are sensitive to some forms of \\ncollusion. Much of the work on implementing DC Nets, for \\nexample, involves ensuring that colluders cannot isolate \\nmessage senders and thereby trace origins and destinations \\nof mail.\\n\\n***\\tcomputationally secure -- where a cipher cannot be \\nbroken with available computer resources, but in theory can \\nbe broken with enough computer resources. Contrast with \\nunconditionally  secure.\\n\\n***\\tcountermeasure -- something you do to thwart an \\nattacker.\\n\\n***\\tcredential -- facts or assertions about some entity. For \\nexample, credit ratings, passports, reputations, tax status, \\ninsurance records, etc.  Under the current system, these \\ncredentials are increasingly being cross-linked. Blind \\nsignatures may be used to create anonymous credentials.\\n\\n***\\tcredential clearinghouse  -- banks, credit agencies, \\ninsurance companies, police departments, etc., that correlate \\nrecords and decide the status of records. \\n\\n***\\tcryptanalysis -- methods for attacking and breaking \\nciphers and related cryptographic systems. Ciphers may be \\nbroken, traffic may be analyzed, and passwords may be \\ncracked. Computers are of course essential.\\n\\n***\\tcrypto anarchy -- the economic and political system \\nafter the deployment of encryption, untraceable e-mail, \\ndigital pseudonyms, cryptographic voting, and digital cash. A \\npun on \"crypto,\" meaning \"hidden,\" and as when Gore Vidal \\ncalled William F. Buckley a \"crypto fascist.\"\\n\\n***\\tcryptography -- another name for cryptology.\\n\\n***\\tcryptology -- the science and study of writing, sending, \\nreceiving, and deciphering secret messages. Includes \\nauthentication, digital signatures, the hiding of messages \\n(steganography), cryptanalysis, and several other fields.\\n\\n***\\tcyberspace  -- the electronic domain, the Nets, and \\ncomputer-generated spaces. Some say it is the \"consensual \\nreality\" described in \"Neuromancer.\" Others say it is the phone \\nsystem. Others have work to do.\\n\\n***\\tDC protocol, or DC-Net -- the dining cryptographers \\nprotocol. DC-Nets use multiple participants communicating \\nwith the DC protocol.\\n\\n***\\tDES -- the Data Encryption Standard, proposed in \\n1977 by the National Bureau of Standards (now NIST), with \\nassistance from the National Security Agency. Based on the \\n\"Lucifer\" cipher developed by Horst Feistel at IBM, DES is a \\nsecret key cryptosystem that cycles 64-bit blocks of data \\nthrough multiple permutations with a 56-bit key controlling \\nthe routing. \"Diffusion\" and \"confusion\" are combined to form \\na cipher that has not yet been cryptanalyzed (see \"DES, \\nSecurity of\"). DES is in use for interbank transfers, as a \\ncipher inside of several RSA-based systems, and is available \\nfor PCs.\\n\\n***\\tDES, Security of  -- many have speculated that the NSA \\nplaced a trapdoor (or back door) in DES to allow it to read \\nDES-encrypted messages. This has not been proved. It is \\nknown that the original Lucifer algorithm used a 128-bit key \\nand that this key length was shortened to 64 bits (56 bits \\nplus 8 parity bits), thus making exhaustive search much \\neasier (so far as is known, brute-force search has not been \\ndone, though it should be feasible today). Shamir and Bihan \\nhave used a technique called \"differential cryptanalysis\" to \\nreduce the exhaustive search needed for chosen plaintext \\nattacks (but with no import for ordinary DES).\\n\\n***\\tdifferential cryptanalysis -- the Shamir-Biham \\ntechnique for cryptanalyzing DES. With a chosen plaintext \\nattack, they\\'ve reduced the number of DES keys that must be \\ntried from about 2^56 to about 2^47 or less. Note, however, \\nthat rarely can an attacker mount a chosen plaintext attack \\non DES systems.\\n\\n***\\tdigital cash, digital money -- Protocols for \\ntransferring value, monetary or otherwise, electronically.  \\nDigital cash usually refers to systems that are anonymous. \\nDigital money systems can be used to implement any quantity \\nthat is conserved, such as points, mass, dollars, etc.  There \\nare many variations of  digital money systems, ranging from \\nVISA numbers to blinded signed digital coins.  A topic too \\nlarge for a single glossary entry.\\n\\n***\\tdigital pseudonym -- basically, a \"crypto identity.\" A \\nway for individuals to set up accounts with various \\norganizations without revealing more information than they \\nwish. Users may have several digital pseudonyms, some used \\nonly once, some used over the course of many years. Ideally, \\nthe pseudonyms can be linked only at the will of the holder. In \\nthe simplest form, a public key can serve as a digital \\npseudonym and need not be linked to a physical identity.\\n\\n***\\tdigital signature --  Analogous to a written signature \\non a document. A modification to a message that only the \\nsigner can make but that everyone can recognize.  Can  be used \\nlegally to contract at a distance.\\n\\n***\\tdigital timestamping -- one function of a digital \\nnotary public, in which some message (a song, screenplay, lab \\nnotebook, contract, etc.) is stamped with a time that cannot \\n(easily) be forged. \\n\\n***\\tdining cryptographers protocol (aka DC protocol, \\nDC nets) -- the untraceable message sending system \\ninvented by David Chaum. Named after the \"dining \\nphilosophers\" problem in computer science, participants form \\ncircuits and pass messages in such a way that the origin \\ncannot be deduced, barring collusion. At the simplest level, \\ntwo participants share a key between them. One of them \\nsends some actual message by bitwise exclusive-ORing the \\nmessage with the key, while the other one just sends the key \\nitself. The actual message from this pair of participants is \\nobtained by XORing the two outputs. However, since nobody \\nbut the pair knows the original key, the actual message \\ncannot be traced to either one of the participants.\\n\\n***\\tdiscrete logarithm problem -- given integers a, n, \\nand x, find some integer m such that a^m mod n = x, if m \\nexists. Modular exponentiation, the a^m mod n part, is \\nstraightforward (and special purpose chips are available), but \\nthe inverse problem is believed to be very hard, in general.  \\nThus it is conjectured that modular exponentiation is a one-\\nway function.\\n\\n***\\tDSS, Digital Signature Standard -- the latest NIST \\n(National Institute of Standards and Technology, successor to \\nNBS) standard for digital signatures. Based on the El Gamal \\ncipher, some consider it weak and poor substitute for RSA-\\nbased signature schemes.\\n\\n***\\teavesdropping, or passive wiretapping -- \\nintercepting messages without detection. Radio waves may be \\nintercepted, phone lines may be tapped, and computers may \\nhave RF emissions detected. Even fiber optic lines can be \\ntapped.\\n\\n***\\tfactoring -- Some large numbers are difficult to factor. \\nIt is conjectured that there are no feasible--i.e.\"easy,\" less \\nthan exponential in size of number-- factoring methods. It is \\nalso an open problem whether RSA may be broken more easily \\nthan by factoring the modulus (e.g., the public key might \\nreveal information which simplifies the problem). \\nInterestingly, though factoring is believed to be \"hard\", it is \\nnot known to be in the class of NP-hard problems. Professor \\nJanek invented a factoring device, but he is believed to be \\nfictional.\\n\\n***\\tinformation-theoretic security -- \"unbreakable\" \\nsecurity, in which no amount of cryptanalysis can break a \\ncipher or system. One time pads are an example (providing the \\npads are not lost nor stolen nor used more than once, of \\ncourse). Same as unconditionally secure.\\n\\n***\\tkey -- a piece of information needed to encipher or \\ndecipher a message. Keys may be stolen, bought, lost, etc., \\njust as with physical keys.\\n\\n***\\tkey exchange, or key distribution -- the process of \\nsharing a key with some other party, in the case of symmetric \\nciphers, or of distributing a  public key in an asymmetric \\ncipher. A major issue is that the keys be exchanged reliably \\nand without compromise. Diffie and Hellman devised one such \\nscheme, based on the discrete logarithm problem. \\n\\n***\\tknown-plaintext attack -- a cryptanalysis of a cipher \\nwhere plaintext-ciphertext pairs are known. This attack \\nsearches for an unknown key. Contrast with the chosen \\nplaintext attack, where the cryptanalyst can also choose the \\nplaintext to be enciphered.\\n\\n***\\tmail, untraceable  -- a system for sending and \\nreceiving mail without traceability or observability. \\nReceiving mail anonymously can be done with broadcast of the \\nmail in encrypted form.  Only the intended recipient (whose \\nidentity, or true name, may be unknown to the sender) may \\nable to decipher the message. Sending mail anonymously \\napparently requires mixes or use of the dining cryptographers \\n(DC) protocol.\\n\\n***\\tminimum disclosure proofs  -- another name for zero \\nknowledge proofs, favored by Chaum.\\n\\n***\\tmixes -- David Chaum\\'s term for a box which performs \\nthe function of mixing, or decorrelating, incoming and \\noutgoing electronic mail messages. The box also strips off \\nthe outer envelope (i.e., decrypts with its private key) and \\nremails the message to the address on the inner envelope. \\nTamper-resistant modules may be used to prevent cheating \\nand forced disclosure of the mapping between incoming and \\noutgoing mail. A sequence of many remailings effectively \\nmakes tracing sending and receiving impossible. Contrast this \\nwith the software version, the DC protocol.\\n\\n***\\tmodular exponentiation  -- raising an integer to the \\npower of another integer, modulo some integer. For integers \\na, n, and m, a^m mod n. For example, 5^3 mod 100 = 25. Modular \\nexponentiation can be done fairly quickly with a sequence of \\nbit shifts and adds, and special purpose chips have been \\ndesigned. See also discrete logarithm.\\n\\n***\\tNational Security Agency (NSA)  -- the largest \\nintelligence agency, responsible for making and breaking \\nciphers, for intercepting communications, and for ensuring \\nthe security of U.S. computers. Headquartered in Fort Meade, \\nMaryland, with many listening posts around the world.  The \\nNSA funds cryptographic research and advises other agencies \\nabout cryptographic matters. The NSA once obviously had the \\nworld\\'s leading cryptologists, but this may no longer be the \\ncase.\\n\\n***\\tnegative credential -- a credential that you possess \\nthat you don\\'t want any one else to know, for example, a \\nbankruptcy filing.  A formal version of a negative reputation.\\n\\n***\\tNP-complete -- a large class of difficult problems.  \\n\"NP\" stands for nondeterministic polynomial time, a class of \\nproblems thought in general not to have feasible algorithms \\nfor their solution.  A problem is \"complete\"  if  any other NP \\nproblem may be reduced to that problem.   Many important \\ncombinatorial and algebraic problems are NP-complete: the \\ntraveling salesman problem, the Hamiltonian cycle problem, \\nthe word problem, and on and on.\\n\\n***\\toblivious transfer -- a cryptographic primitive that \\ninvolves the probabilistic transmission of bits. The sender \\ndoes not know if the bits were received.\\n\\n***\\tone-time pad -- a string of randomly-selected bits or \\nsymbols which is combined with a plaintext message to \\nproduce the ciphertext. This combination may be shifting \\nletters some amount, bitwise exclusive-ORed, etc.). The \\nrecipient, who also has a copy of the one time pad, can easily \\nrecover the plaintext. Provided the pad is only used once and \\nthen destroyed, and is not available to an eavesdropper, the \\nsystem is perfectly secure, i.e., it is information-\\ntheoretically secure. Key distribution (the pad)  is obviously a \\npractical concern, but consider CD-ROM\\'s.\\n\\n***\\tone-way function -- a function which is easy to \\ncompute in one direction but hard to find any inverse for, e.g. \\nmodular exponentiation, where the inverse problem is known \\nas the discrete logarithm problem. Compare the special case \\nof trap door one-way functions.  An example of  a one-way \\noperation is multiplication: it is  easy to multiply two \\nprime numbers of 100 digits to produce a 200-digit number, \\nbut  hard to factor that 200-digit number. \\n\\n***\\tP ?=? NP  -- Certainly the most  important unsolved \\nproblem in complexity theory. If P = NP, then cryptography as \\nwe know it today does not exist.  If P = NP,  all NP problems \\nare \"easy.\" \\n\\n***\\tpadding -- sending extra messages to confuse \\neavesdroppers and to defeat traffic analysis.   Also adding \\nrandom bits to a message to be enciphered.\\n\\n***\\tplaintext -- also called cleartext, the text that is to be \\nenciphered.\\n\\n***\\tPretty Good Privacy (PGP)  -- Phillip ZimmermanUs \\nimplementation of RSA, recently upgraded to version 2.0, \\nwith more robust components and several new features. RSA \\nData Security has threatened PZ so he no longer works on it.  \\nVersion 2.0 was written by a consortium of non-U.S. hackers.\\n\\n***\\tprime numbers -- integers with no factors other than \\nthemselves and 1. The number of primes is unbounded.  About \\n1% of the 100 decimal digit numbers are prime.  Since there \\nare about 10^70 particles in the universe, there are about \\n10^23  100 digit primes for each and every particle in the \\nuniverse!\\n\\n***\\tprobabilistic encryption  -- a scheme by Goldwasser, \\nMicali, and Blum that allows multiple ciphertexts for the \\nsame plaintext, i.e., any given plaintext may have many \\nciphertexts if the ciphering is repeated. This protects against \\ncertain types of known ciphertext attacks on RSA.\\n\\n***\\tproofs of identity -- proving who you are, either your \\ntrue name, or your digital identity. Generally, possession of \\nthe right key is sufficient proof (guard your key!). Some work \\nhas been done on \"is-a-person\" credentialling agencies, using \\nthe so-called Fiat-Shamir protocol...think of this as a way to \\nissue unforgeable digital passports. Physical proof of identity \\nmay be done with biometric security methods. Zero knowledge \\nproofs of identity reveal nothing beyond the fact that the \\nidentity is as claimed. This has obvious uses for computer \\naccess, passwords, etc.\\n\\n***\\tprotocol -- a formal procedure for solving some \\nproblem. Modern cryptology is mostly about the study of \\nprotocols for many problems, such as coin-flipping, bit \\ncommitment (blobs), zero knowledge proofs, dining \\ncryptographers, and so on.\\n\\n***\\tpublic key -- the key distributed publicly to potential \\nmessage-senders. It may be published in a phonebook-like \\ndirectory or otherwise sent. A major concern is the validity \\nof this public key to guard against spoofing or impersonation.\\n\\n***\\tpublic key cryptosystem -- the modern breakthrough \\nin cryptology, designed by Diffie and Hellman, with \\ncontributions from several others. Uses trap door one-way \\nfunctions so that encryption may be done by anyone with \\naccess to the \"public key\" but decryption may be done only by \\nthe holder of the \"private key.\" Encompasses public key \\nencryption, digital signatures, digital cash, and many other \\nprotocols and applications.\\n\\n***\\tpublic key encryption -- the use of modern \\ncryptologic methods to provided message security and \\nauthentication. The RSA algorithm is the most widely used \\nform of public key encryption, although other systems exist. \\nA public key may be freely published, e.g., in phonebook-like \\ndirectories, while the corresponding private key is closely \\nguarded.\\n\\n***\\tpublic key patents  -- M.I.T. and Stanford, due to the \\nwork of Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle, \\nformed Public Key Partners to license the various public key, \\ndigital signature, and RSA patents. These patents, granted in \\nthe early 1980s, expire in the between 1998 and 2002. PKP \\nhas licensed RSA Data Security Inc., of Redwood City, CA, \\nwhich handles the sales, etc.\\n\\n***\\tquantum cryptography -- a system based on quantum-\\nmechanical principles. Eavesdroppers alter the quantum state \\nof the system and so are detected. Developed by Brassard and \\nBennett, only small laboratory demonstrations have been \\nmade.\\n\\n***\\treputations -- the trail of positive and negative \\nassociations and judgments that some entity accrues. Credit \\nratings, academic credentials, and trustworthiness are all \\nexamples. A digital pseudonym will accrue these reputation \\ncredentials based on actions, opinions of others, etc. In \\ncrypto anarchy, reputations and agoric systems will be of \\nparamount importance. There are many fascinating issues of \\nhow reputation-based systems work, how credentials can be \\nbought and sold, and so forth.\\n\\n***\\tRSA -- the main public key encryption algorithm, \\ndeveloped by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Kenneth Adleman. It \\nexploits the difficulty of factoring large numbers to create a \\nprivate key and public key. First invented in 1978, it remains \\nthe core of modern public key systems. It is usually much \\nslower than DES, but special-purpose modular exponentiation \\nchips will likely speed it up. A popular scheme for speed is to \\nuse RSA to transmit session keys and then a high-speed \\ncipher like DES for the actual message text.\\n***\\tDescription -- Let p and q be large primes, typically with more than \\n100 digits. Let n = pq and find some e such that e is relatively prime to (p \\n- 1)(q - 1). The set of numbers p, q, and e is the private key for RSA. The \\nset of numbers n and e forms the public key (recall that knowing n is not \\nsufficient to easily find p and q...the factoring problem).  A message M is \\nencrypted by computing M^e mod n. The owner of the private key can \\ndecrypt the encrypted message by exploiting number theory results, as \\nfollows. An integer d is computed such that ed =1 (mod (p - 1)(q - 1)). \\nEuler proved a theorem that M^(ed) = M mod n and so M^(ed) mod n = M. \\nThis means that in some sense the integers e and d are \"inverses\" of each \\nother. [If this is unclear, please see one of the many texts and articles on \\npublic key encryption.]\\n\\n***\\tsecret key cryptosystem -- A system which uses the \\nsame key to encrypt and decrypt traffic at each end of a \\ncommunication link.  Also called a symmetric or one-key \\nsystem.  Contrast with public key cryptosystem.\\n\\n***\\tsmart cards -- a computer chip embedded in credit \\ncard.  They can hold cash, credentials, cryptographic keys, \\netc. Usually these are built with some degree of tamper-\\nresistance. Smart cards may perform part of a crypto \\ntransaction, or all of it. Performing part of it may mean \\nchecking the computations of a more powerful computer, e.g., \\none in an ATM.\\n\\n***\\tspoofing, or masquerading -- posing as another user. \\nUsed for stealing passwords, modifying files, and  stealing \\ncash. Digital signatures and other authentication methods are \\nuseful to prevent this. Public keys must be validated and \\nprotected to ensure that others don\\'t substitute their own \\npublic keys which users may then unwittingly use.\\n\\n***\\tsteganography -- a part of cryptology dealing with \\nhiding messages and obscuring who is sending and receiving \\nmessages. Message traffic is often padded to reduce the \\nsignals that would otherwise come from a sudden beginning \\nof messages.\\n\\n***\\tsymmetric cipher -- same as private key \\ncryptosystem.\\n \\n***\\ttamper-responding modules, tamper-resistant \\nmodules (TRMs) -- sealed boxes or modules which are hard \\nto open, requiring extensive probing and usually leaving ample \\nevidence that the tampering has occurred. Various protective \\ntechniques are used, such as special metal or oxide layers on \\nchips, armored coatings, embedded optical fibers, and other \\nmeasures to thwart analysis. Popularly called \"tamper-proof \\nboxes.\" Uses include: smart cards, nuclear weapon initiators, \\ncryptographic key holders, ATMs, etc.\\n\\n***\\ttampering, or active wiretapping -- interfering with \\nmessages and possibly modifying them. This may compromise \\ndata security, help to break ciphers, etc.  See also spoofing.\\n\\n***\\ttoken -- some representation, such as ID cards, subway \\ntokens, money, etc., that indicates possession of some \\nproperty or value. \\n\\n***\\ttraffic analysis -- determining who is sending or \\nreceiving messages by analyzing packets, frequency of \\npackets, etc. A part of steganography. Usually handled with \\ntraffic padding.\\n\\n***\\ttransmission rules -- the protocols for determining \\nwho can send messages in a DC protocol, and when. These \\nrules are needed to prevent collision and deliberate jamming \\nof the channels.\\n\\n***\\ttrap messages -- dummy messages in DC Nets which \\nare used to catch jammers and disrupters. The messages \\ncontain no private information and are published in a blob \\nbeforehand so that the trap message can later be opened to \\nreveal the disrupter. (There are many strategies to explore \\nhere.)\\n\\n***\\ttrap-door -- In cryptography, a piece of secret \\ninformation that allows the holder of a private key to invert a \\nnormally hard to invert function.\\n\\n***\\ttrap-door one way functions -- functions which are \\neasy to compute in both the forward and reverse direction but \\nfor which the disclosure of an algorithm to compute the \\nfunction in the forward direction does not provide \\ninformation on how to compute the function in the reverse \\ndirection. More simply put, trap-door one way functions are \\none way for all but the holder of the secret information. The \\nRSA algorithm is the best-known example of such a function.\\n\\n***\\tunconditional security -- same as information-\\ntheoretic security, that is, unbreakable except by loss or \\ntheft of the key.\\n\\n***\\tunconditionally  secure -- where no amount of \\nintercepted ciphertext is enough to allow the cipher to be \\nbroken, as with the use of a one-time pad cipher. Contrast \\nwith computationally secure.\\n\\n***\\tvoting, cryptographic -- Various schemes have been \\ndevised for anonymous, untraceable voting. Voting schemes \\nshould have several properties: privacy of the vote, security \\nof the vote (no multiple votes), robustness against disruption \\nby jammers or disrupters, verifiability (voter has confidence \\nin the results), and efficiency.\\n\\n***\\tzero knowledge proofs -- proofs in which no \\nknowledge of the actual proof is conveyed. Peggy the Prover \\ndemonstrates to Sid the Skeptic that she is indeed in \\npossession of some piece of knowledge without actually \\nrevealing any of that knowledge. This is useful for access to \\ncomputers, because eavesdroppers or dishonest sysops cannot \\nsteal the knowledge given. Also called minimum disclosure \\nproofs. Useful for proving possession of some property, or \\ncredential, such as age or voting status, without revealing \\npersonal information.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

May\\ntcmay@netcom.com\\n\\n\\nA specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto \\nanarchy. \\n\\nComputer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for \\nindividuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other \\nin a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange \\nmessages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts \\nwithout ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. \\nInteractions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-\\nrouting of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which \\nimplement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance \\nagainst any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far \\nmore important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. \\nThese developments will alter completely the nature of government \\nregulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the \\nability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of \\ntrust and reputation.\\n\\nThe technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social \\nand economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. \\nThe methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge \\ninteractive proof systems, and various software protocols for \\ninteraction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now \\nbeen on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences \\nmonitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently \\nhave computer networks and  personal computers attained sufficient \\nspeed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten \\nyears will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas \\neconomically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed \\nnetworks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band \\ntransmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips \\nnow under development will be some of the enabling technologies. \\n\\nThe State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this \\ntechnology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology \\nby drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. \\nMany of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow \\nnational secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen \\nmaterials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will \\neven make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and \\nextortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users \\nof CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.\\n\\nJust as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of \\nmedieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will \\ncryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations \\nand of government interference in economic transactions. Combined \\nwith emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a \\nliquid market for any and all material which can be put into words \\nand pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed \\nwire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus \\naltering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the \\nfrontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an \\narcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which \\ndismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.\\n\\nArise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!\\n\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

One a\\nshort term team which no doubt will be what exists already,  and\\na long term team to do a more Mac\\'ish GUI.  I agreed to do that,\\nand Phil is planning to set up a phone conference call with the\\nentire Mac PGP team to introduce the new proposals to everyone\\nat once.  this meeting will happen sometime early this week,  and\\nI\\'ll be giving reports on what has transpired.\\n\\n   I also sent to each of the Mac PGP members the details of the\\ncypherspace meeting,  but have not yet mentioned my proposal to \\nhelp manage the team,   as I want to meet everyone first.\\n\\n   I also agreed to make up a function list of the C functions in the\\nPGP program (Which I usually do when I study new code),   and will send \\nit to anyone who wants it.   \\n\\n   Oh!! By the way,  If I start up the existing Mac PGP,  running\\nMicrophone II at the same time.    Then,  when I encrypt a file,\\nit hangs up the system.    This only hangs up when I decrypt a file\\nfirst,  then I go into editor to edit a file,  and save it.   After\\nsaving the plaintext file,  then I encrypt it,   it will hang up the Mac\\nand needs resetting.   It requires a COLD boot,  and not a simple\\nreset.   Has anyone else experienced this problem?  I suspect that\\na new version of Mac PGP might soon become available.

Faster and more complete tax collection, with the tax authorities\\nand implicit partner in all economic transactions (save for black\\nmarkets, but I\\'ll discuss that later).\\n\\nThe \"faster\" part will be a one-shot gain, just as the witholding tax\\nsystem instituted in WWII as an emergency program was a one-shot\\nbenefit. But such an immediate gain may be quite attractive to\\nplanners faced with rapidly escalating national debt. ($4.5 trillion,\\nincreasing by at least $400 billion a year...more if the \"IOUs\" for\\nsocial security are considered)\\n\\nThe \"more complete\" part will be an attempt to recapture taxes now\\nlost to the underground, or barter, economy. \"Serious\" black\\nmarketeers, or dealers in illegal substances, will of course not be\\ngreatly affected, but a shift to purely electronic money will hurt\\ntheir ability to move money (unless they control the banks and S&Ls,\\nas may be the case....but that\\'s another story).\\n\\n2. A general closing of the underground economy, separate from the\\nissue of recapturing lost tax revenues. As the underground economy\\nincreases, especially to the levels seen in other countries, pressures\\nto \"close the loopholes\" (= cash) may mount. The failing \"War on\\nDrugs\" has already been used to justify many serious abridgements of\\nbasic rights; applying the same logic to creating a cashless society\\nseems to be the next step.\\n\\n3. \"Welfare reform\" by restricting the allowable expenditures that can\\nbe made. For example, a welfare, food stamp, or AFDC recipient could\\nbe barred from buying liquor with his or her \"money.\" Electronic money\\nneed not be \"fungible,\" in the sense that all forms are\\ninterchangeable--it is fairly easy to attach various restrictions to\\nthe electronic databases which hold the money.\\n\\nSuch restrictions would meet with a lot of popular support, and so\\ncould undercut the protests a bit. (Support may also come from the\\n\"national identity card\" aspects, as such a card would help to solve\\nthe problem of illegal immigrants and those who move to jurisdictions\\nwith better welfare benefits. I\\'m not _approving_ of this, merely\\npointing out a source of support for \"welfare cards.\")\\n\\n(Bypasses can still be done, as with food stamps which are sold in\\nexchange for booze. Ironically, the flourishing black market in food\\nstamps is a motivation for going to an \"electronic welfare card,\"\\nwhich is being talked about and which is an obvious precursor step to\\nthe eventual ban on paper money cash.)\\n\\n4. Fears of the growing ease of counterfeiting may push this shift\\nalong. Color copiers are now so good that nearly undetectable\\ncounterfeiting of U.S. currency is straightforward. Attempts to embed\\nconductive threads, holograms, etc., are helping, but the longterm\\nfuture is not bright for physical money (excluding gold, which has its\\nown problems that I won\\'t discuss here).\\n\\n(Note that foreign printing presses can quite easily produce excellent\\ncounterfeit currency, for use in destabilizing foreign regimes, in\\neconomic warfare, etc. Apparently the U.S. has supported the flooding\\nof Iraq with counterfeit currency. And Iraq has supposedly printed\\nvast amounts of counterfeit U.S. and European currency. Digital money,\\ncryptographically protected, is about the only protection against this\\nthreat.)\\n\\n5. If the government controls and sets the protocols for electronic\\nmoney, this gives them de facto control over encryption systems and\\nprotocols.  Use of non-approved protocols may be considered ipso facto\\nproof of money laundering, black marketeering, and tax evasion.\\n\\nThe Dennning/Rivest key registration proposal appears to be some\\nadvance planning for creating a system in which the government is\\neffectively a third party in all communications (= transactions). \\n\\nI suggest we look at all such key registration proposals in this light.\\n\\n6. More speculatively, the elimination of cash may be used to prop up\\nU.S. banks, which many feel are facing a rocky future. By making the\\nbanks the \"mediators\" of such a government-mandated electronic money\\nsystem, this both \"privatizes\" the system and provides a new revenue\\nstream for these powerful lobbying interests. For example, your local\\nbank may issue the debit card and may take, say, 0.5% of every\\ntransaction. The government might then take, say, 3% of every\\ntransaction as its \"cut.\" (The actual details are likely to be\\nhideously complex, along the lines of the V.A.T. taxes of Europe, and\\nso this example should only be taken as a rough example of what could\\nhappen.)\\n\\n\\nNow it has long been clear to me that the future of money lies in\\nelectronic form, cryptographically protected. The prolific use of\\ncredit cards for mail-order purchases points to the need for a purely\\nelectronic form of usable money, as do systems like AMIX (which uses\\nVISA-type credits and debits). The issue is who creates this system,\\nand what controls exist.\\n\\nIt seems unlikely that the U.S. government will allow \"competing\\ncurrencies\" (one form of digital money, and arguably what we already\\nhave with various tradable financial instruments, which rise and fall\\nin value depending on various forces) to spring into being, at least\\nnot in forms that are truly like cash.\\n\\nHowever, if the government creates this cashless society, then the government\\nwill have unprecedented control over nearly all aspects of our lives.\\nAll transactions, no matter how trivial, will be recorded, stored, and\\nsubject to analysis. A complete audit trail of all purchases, food\\npreferences, entertainment choices, liasons with others, etc., will\\nexist. This is the concern David Chaum has eloquently raised, and\\nwhich he has been dealing with (partially) with his digital money and\\nuntraceable transactions systems.\\n\\nFurthermore, transactions which are deemed to be politically\\nincorrect, and there are dozens of obvious examples to choose from,\\ncan be _outlawed_ by the mere typing of a few lines of instructions into\\nthe appropriate data bases. (For example, someone arrested for DUI\\ntries to buy some beer...\"Your transaction cannot be completed. Have a\\nnice day.\"  appears on the cash register. Or a pregnant woman--and\\nunder Clinton\\'s computerized health care system this will all be\\nknown--tries to buy some cigarettes....)\\n\\nReread John Brunner\\'s amazingly prescient \"Shockwave Rider\" for some\\nvisions of a fully-computerized society.\\n\\nThis trend toward a cashless society, controlled by the government,\\nrepresents the greatest threat to our libery and our future I can\\nimagine.\\n\\nWe need to start planning to head this off. Those interested in\\n\"crypto anarchy\" as one technological solution are encourage to get in\\ntouch with me.\\n\\n(I now have MacPGP, which makes things slightly easier than before,\\nbut it\\'s still a pain to download files and decrypt them. The\\nanonymous remailer services discussed on the \"Cypherpunks\" list should\\nhelp as well.)\\n\\nMake no mistake, a government-run cashless society will be worse that\\nOrwell\\'s worst.\\n\\n--Tim May\\n\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

Not that RSA hasn\\'t been around forever, but it\\njust wasn\\'t useable without a standard.  My deepest gratitude\\nto you and your friends.\\n\\nThe remailer business needs to get standardized also.  My personal\\nhack is attached below.  One problem not addressed in the first\\ncrop of remailers is the problem of how do you handle return\\npaths.  There are lots of trivial ways to get anonymous outgoing\\nmail. Most telephone systems do not identify the caller, there are\\nlots of other ways to get this function.  But the problem is getting\\nan answer back with out unmasking.  The mathematicians may be able to\\nconjure up a better scheme, but I see the backward security to be\\nsimply a matter of tearing the connection (return path down) faster\\nthan it can be backtraced.  It would be nicer if some kind of\\nDC-net return path could be devised.  But timeout control will \\ndefinitely work. With a large number of the forwaring nodes, and\\nmulti-hop paths, it would become quickly very impractical to shake\\ndown the originator,  So the return path could be left \"up\" for \\nquite some time before having to replace it.  Certainly long enough\\nfor a reasonable reply.  Better yet of cource would be a completely\\nuncrackable return path that you could leave up long enough to use\\ninstitutional advertising.  Eg: run a business from.\\n\\nAnother way to leave up long lasting connections (return paths)\\nis to select one really HARD point node.  This is the one they\\nhave to shake down first.  And use continuously shifting paths\\nbehind that node.  (all sounds like a router ? ) \\n\\nIf you could repost this anonymously\\nI sure would appreciate it.

I\\'ve started studying more of the fundamentals (I\\'ve only read \\nDavid Kahn\\'s book, back in 8th grade, which was a while ago :-) I\\'m \\nespecially interested in the MIME/PEM issues, and fervently request coredumps \\nfrom anyone who\\'s been following those to date. \\n\\nMy company (which I DO NOT speak for) develops TCP/IP based communications \\nsoftware for the Mac, so needless to say, a nice RSA-encrypted Mac mailer \\ncould fall within our purview.

(I suspect that I\\'d use this \\n\\tmostly for testing the \\'engines\\')\\n\\nI want to reiterate the sentiment posted by several to KEEP THINGS PORTABLE. \\nI know it\\'s not chic for a Mac developer to say that, but so be it.\\n\\nBob Stratton     Engineer, InterCon Systems Corp.     <strat@intercon.com>\\n+1 703 709 5525\\n\"The Constitution\\'s not perfect, but it\\'s a damn sight better than what we \\nhave now.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: nobody@alumni.cco.caltech.edu\\nDate: Tue, 24 Nov 92 22:12:47 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: Extortion Explosion\\nMessage-ID: <9211250614.AA17663@alumni.cco.caltech.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s another thought about how crypto anonymity can improve\\npublic safety.\\n\\nToday, a lot of police activity is based on informants and \"anonymous\"\\ntips.  Policemen build up relationships with underworld characters\\nwho can give them information about criminal activity.  In return,\\nthe police may offer favors, immunity from arrest, perhaps even\\ncash or contraband in some instances.\\n\\nSome people have claimed that \"anonymous sources\" are an excuse sometimes\\nused to cover up illegal police activity.  An illegal wiretap is used\\nto acquire information, then a warrant is obtained based on this\\ninformation with the claim that it was actually acquired through\\nan anonymous informant.  With the warrant in place, the wiretap is now\\ndone legally, and evidence is produced which can be used in court.\\n\\nOne problem with anonymous tips is that the people making them are\\ntaking a risk.  If word gets out that a certain person tipped off\\nthe police to some criminal act, they may be targetted for revenge.\\nPersonal meetings between police and informers are often necessary\\n(perhaps for payoffs to occur) and these are risky for all involved.\\n\\nCrypto anonymity could make anonymous informing easy and safe.  Of\\ncourse, not all tips would be valuable, but some fraction would be\\nhelpful in preventing crimes.  Crypto pseudonyms and signatures could\\nbe used for informants to develop reputations so that those who have\\nbeen accurate in the past will get the most attention.  Digital cash\\ncould even be used for payoffs from cops to informants \"under the\\ntable\", with no need for dangerous face-to-face meetings.\\n\\nA system could even develop in which police would have to bring to\\na judge not just a blanket claim that there was an anonymous informant,\\nbut more substantial evidence, in the form of a digitally signed statement\\nby a pseudonym known to have produced useful information in the past.\\nThis could reduce the problem of imaginary informants invented to\\nexcuse illegal police activity.\\n\\nPolyanna \\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nmQA9AisGm6sAAAEBgLsub7XIi32DjNFKJmGFajDNNIeql4RBmHG/mh9Ns58aBgMv\\nwGRi0KkZ0YIYZZnLpwAFEbQkUG9seWFubmEsIGMvbyA8Y3lwaGVycHVua3NAdG9h\\nZC5jb20+\\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: DELTORTO@AppleLink.Apple.COM (Imaja, David Del Torto,PAS)\\nDate: Tue, 24 Nov 92 16:36:01 PST\\nTo: CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM\\nSubject: virgin key\\nMessage-ID: <722650089.8392816@AppleLink.Apple.COM>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nGreetings CypherFolk,\\n \\nI\\'m still in Europe, researching combinations of sleep deprivation and extended\\ntrain travel, but the time for return to sf.ca.us is drawing closer.

Thus it would work with any of the great\\nvariety of e-mail and BBS sysetems that exist, instead of having to\\ndeal with each of them individually as a purely software-based approach\\nwould have to.  It would also be completely independent of the type of\\ncomputer/terminal or operating system used.\\n\\nYou would send the usual mail command to the host, type the magic\\nsequence to the encryption device (or even better, flip a little\\nswitch), and then type your message.  The device would send to the host\\nthe ciphertext, while echoing the plaintext to your terminal so you can\\nsee what you are typing.  The plaintext would never travel further than\\nthe RS232 connection between your terminal and the encryption device.\\n\\nWhen you receive an encrypted message, flip the switch on your device\\nto \"decrypt\", and tell the host to send you the message.  The host and\\nany intervening networks would only see the ciphertext.  The only place\\nthe decrypted text appears is on your terminal.  I think this is as\\nsecure as you can get (until a decryption implant can be put in your\\nhead :-).\\n\\nNow, to allow the use of existing tools (pagers, editors, mailers, etc)\\nthe device should be completely transparent except when performing the\\ncrypto function.  Even then, careful design should make it pretty\\ntransparent.  For example if it passed all control characters intact,\\nit could be used with a text editor that uses control key sequences for\\nmovement.  It could be programmed for most common arrow key sequences,\\nand for commands for editors such as EMACS, vi, etc, to pass them\\nthrough unchanged.\\n\\nSame thing for receiving. When decrypting, it should pass through\\nunchanged any characters passing through the other way, and should not\\ninterfere with terminal control characters, so any mail viewing program\\nwould not be affected.\\n\\nAdditional functions it might include are generation and verification\\nof signatures, an echo mode with decrypt/encrypt (so you could store\\nthe encrypted texts on your local drive, and to view would just \"ascii\\nupload\" them to the device while in a comm program; also you could\\nprepare the text of a message locally, while storing the encrypted text\\nechoed back. Then you could upload the cyphertext to the system), a\\nsimple local editor and viewer, and anything else we have the ROM space\\nfor.  Once the basic hardware is developed, there is nothing to stop\\none from including any desired features.\\n\\nIs anyone here already working on something like this?  If not, is\\nanyone interested in working with me on developing this kind of a\\ndevice?  I have the design pretty much thought out (this post is just a\\nsummary).  I also have a clear picture of the prototyping and\\ndevelopment process, and am capable of writing the software part.  I\\nwould like to work with a partner who knows the hardware part of all\\nthis.  I.E. the RS232/UART control, PCB layouts, that kind of stuff.\\nAlso, I know almost nothing about the technology of tamperproof memory\\nstorage.\\n\\nThe main objective of this is not to make loads of money (though that\\nwould not hurt either) but to increase widespread accessibility and use\\nof good crypto technology.  So I would make the schematics and code\\navailable, in case anyone wants to be SURE and build one themselves.\\nThis could probably also be made available in kit form, that could be\\nassembled by the user.  (an interesting parrallel: this is how the\\npersonal computer was first distributed... look at the prevalence of PC\\nuse today!) This way they can be more sure that it does what it says it\\ndoes.\\n\\nSo, if you have read this far you are probably interested in this.\\nPLEASE reply to me or to the list.

Most supermarkets now take plastic...ATM/credit card readers\\nare installed in the checkout lanes. The clerks tell me they actually\\nprefer the plastic, as so little work is needed. (Much faster than\\nchecks, which most people not using plastic use). This installed base\\nof card readers already covers about 80% of all common transactions, I\\nwould estimate.\\n\\n> 2) Bribe income of the rulers would be affected.\\n\\nA good point, also made by Keith Henson (in e-mail). Politicians want\\ncash for off-the-record transactions, their sexual liaisons, etc.\\nMaybe the corruption of politicians will be our salvation! (More\\nlikely: exemptions...Congress exempts itself from many laws. Also, the\\nvarious onerous financial disclosure laws directly affect politicians,\\nand they made it into law.)\\n\\n> 3) The illiterate, the retarded, and those with poor management skills depend\\n>    on a cash accounting system to run their lives.  They would not be able\\n>    to survive in a card-based economy.  20% of the US pop. have no checking\\n>    accounts and 40% have no plastic.\\n\\nI notice plenty of semi-literate folks handing their plastic to the\\ncashier! Those without checking accounts tend to use \"money orders,\"\\nthough, so mandating a conversion would be possible. Many of those\\nwithout checking or plastic accounts simply don\\'t \"qualify.\" (Trend:\\nqualification standards have been dropping every year) A\\ngovernment-run credit/debit card program would ensure that everyone\\ngot a card. Illiteracy is no problem, as there is virtually nothing to\\nread or write when using plastic. (Adding voice synthesis to some of\\nthe card readers would even be seen as a selling point with the blind\\nor physically disabled.)\\n\\n> 4) The destruction of the Underground Economy would be socially regressive\\n>    since it would fall most heavily on the poor.  Poor households spend twice\\n>    their reported income.\\n\\nPossibly true, but this won\\'t cut the mustard when it comes to passing\\nthe laws. The laws will be presented as a way to \"close the loopholes\"\\non the rich, not to soak the poor.\\n\\nThe talk of a \"welfare credit card\" to deal with the theft of welfare\\nand social security checks (a big problem in the U.S., obviously\\naffecting mostly the poor) will likely result in some form of\\ngovernment-mandated card system in the next couple of years. \\n\\n> 5) The destruction of the Underground Economy would hurt the Gross Domestic\\n>    Product and cause recession.\\n\\nProbably not a concern to the planners, but perhaps. It is not\\npolitically correct to talk about this.\\n\\n> 6) Foreigners need to be able to participate in the system.  Unless *all*\\n>    nations jointly go to an electronic payments system, there will be loopholes\\n>    that domestic residents can exploit.\\n\\nBut foreigners already have to comply with U.S. banking laws (though\\nof course they often don\\'t, but that\\'s another story). Foreigners\\nplanning to convert pounds or francs to cash dollars would simply\\nconvert them to electronic dollars, \"charging\" up their\\ndebit/credit/etc. card. (As a parallel, the law from 1933 to 1976 or\\nso was that Americans could not possess gold in any form except\\njewelry or rare coins. Other countries had no such laws. Did we see\\nBritish visitors flouting the laws by spending gold guineas?)\\n\\n> 7) As long as foreign practices differ, domestic residents could get overseas\\n>    Visa debit cards and ATM cards and avoid the domestic social controls.\\n\\nThis could be a real stopper. Perhaps the U.S. and its New World Order\\nwill push for a nearly simultaneous conversion, as part of the GATT\\ntalks, the various monetary talks, etc.\\n\\nAlso, using foreign-based cards could simply be declared illegal.\\nTie-ins to Immigration and Passport control could allow foreign\\nvisitors to use their foreing cards for, say, 90 days, or\\nwhatever....this would also be a way to control illegal immigrants who\\noverstay their temporary visa. The cleanest solution would be to tie a\\n\"tempory visa\" to a \"temporary VISA\" (pun intended), in which a\\nvisitor would receive a card upon arrival, just as he now changes his\\nfrancs and marks for dollars.\\n\\n> 8) The vast majority of the world\\'s population is still in a cash or barter \\n>    economy and could not be converted to plastic.  This would leave overseas\\n>    cash that would be a system loophole.\\nSee above.\\n\\n> 9) There is now no central financial authority.

A central authority would be expensive and technically\\n>    challenging.\\n\\nAh, but these clearinghouses are becoming more tightly integrated. A\\nVISA transactions costs about $0.10, and this is dropping yearly. A\\ntypical transaction can be sent out over phone lines in seconds and\\nover high-speed ISDN lines in fractions of a second. Fiber optic lines\\nmake it ridiculously easy.\\n\\nBesides, it it not necessarily the case that there would be one\\ncentral authority which would validate transactions (that would be too\\nvulnerable to single-point failures and sabotage). Transactions would\\nmostly be similar to today\\'s transactions, with records sent\\nperiodically to the government(s).\\n\\n\\n> 10)A central financial authority would exceed the institutional abilities of \\n>    current international arrangements, would be opposed by the banks (cost and \\n>    independence), would constrain the growth of the financial services industry\\n>    and would run counter to the trend of financial deregulation.\\n\\nHere in the U.S. the banks have acquiesced to nearly all of the\\nonerous new reporting regulations (cash transactions over\\n$10,000--soon to be less--and disclosure laws) resulting from the War\\non Drugs. Banks are now creatures of the government, jumping when told\\nto. Also, when the various laws are seen as _profit sources_ (as in\\nthe FBI\\'s Digital Telephony Bill, which would compensate phone\\ncompanies for tapping customers) then banks will be happy to add a\\nservice charge to cover their expenses.\\n\\nFurthermore, and this goes to your point below as well, banks will\\npush for legislation that forces theri competitors to do exactly the\\nsame as they are doing.

After that it\\ndeletes the remembered forwarding request for security.\\n\\nI wouldn\\'t object to this that much on security grounds; as David\\npointed out, even a full implementation of Chaum\\'s \"mix\" remailer\\nwould fall to infiltration.  Instead, I think there are some issues\\ninvolving usability.\\n\\nFor one thing, it sounds like this system is use-once as far as the\\nanonymous return address.  If David replied to me, then thought of\\nsomething he wanted to add, his second message wouldn\\'t get through to\\nme.\\n\\nAnother problem is, what if two people send anonymous mail to David\\nvia the same forwarder.  Then, when he replies, how does the forwarder\\nknow which of the two to forward the reply to?\\n\\nIt\\'s also asymmetric, in that it will only work if one of the two\\ncommunicants knows the true address of the other.  A lot of the\\ninteresting features of Tim\\'s \"crypto anarchy\" only arise if\\npeople can communicate without either one knowing the other\\'s true\\naddress.\\n\\nLet me mention a couple of other ideas which I\\'ve heard of for anonymous\\nreturn addresses.  One idea was posted several months ago on the\\nExtropians list by Eric Messick.  (Is he on this list?)  It used\\na \"pseudonym-based post office box\".  You would send a message to\\na remailing server saying, \"Please save mail addressed to pseudonym\\nXYZ123.  I will pick it up later.  Here is the public key I will\\nuse to authorize the pick-up, and here is some digital cash to\\npay for your trouble.  Thank you.\"  Then you send mail anonymously\\ngiving XYZ123@remailer.com as your return address.  This mail\\nstacks up at the remailer which saves it for you.  At some later\\ndate you send a signed message to the remailer saying, \"OK, send XYZ123\\'s\\nmail to me@me.com.\"\\n\\nEric Hughes had an idea which was somewhat like this but without\\nthe delay aspect.  You would just set up an account with a remailer\\nwhereby all mail to XYZ123 would be forwarded to yourself.  Then\\nXYZ123@remailer.com would be your return address.  This could include\\nDavid\\'s idea if you asked the server to delete your pseudonym after\\nusing it once.\\n\\nAll of these anonymous return address proposals can be enhanced by\\nusing a cascade or chain of remailers for your A.R.A.\\n\\nChaum\\'s \"mix\" remailer would save up a batch of cryptographically\\nprotected messages, decrypt them, rearrange their order randomly, then\\nsend them out.  This way if the remailer itself is secure but the\\nnetwork connections to it are being monitored, the correspondance\\nbetween incoming and outgoing messages is lost.  The other ARA\\nsuggestions could also benefit from this enhancement.\\n\\nChaum\\'s idea for an anonymous return address was a somewhat more\\ncomplicated form of the ARA I\\'ve implemented for my remailer.  My\\nARA is simply a forwarding instruction, encrypted with the public\\nkey of the remailer.  The advantage of this system is that you don\\'t\\nhave to \"register\" with the remailer(s) in advance.  It\\'s less\\nconvenient than the other proposals, though, and there is the danger\\nthat the public key(s) of the remailer(s) involved would be revealed\\nat some time in the future, which would then reveal that that old ARA\\nreally was you.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: ghsvax!hal@uunet.UU.NET (Hal Finney)\\nDate: Wed, 25 Nov 92 13:04:57 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Electronic Banking\\nMessage-ID: <9211251953.AA01487@nano.noname>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nSome time back Tim May suggested that we should do some experiments\\nwith electronic cash.  He offered to do some Xeroxing if people would\\n\"pay\" him.\\n\\nThere are lots of proposals for electronic cash in the literature,\\nmostly very complex.  I think one of Chaum\\'s simpler proposals would be\\nadequate for email \"banking\".  This proposal, from the beginning of\\nhis paper \"Untraceable Electronic Cash\" in Crypto 88(?), goes like\\nthis:\\n\\n1. Alice chooses a random x and r, and supplies the bank with\\nB=r^3*f(x) mod n, where f is a one-way function (like MD5), and n is\\nthe modulus for the bank\\'s public key.\\n\\n2. The bank takes the third root of B (e.g. via an RSA decryption) and\\nsends it back to Alice: D = r * f(x)^(1/3), and withdraws one dollar from\\nher account.\\n\\n3. Alice extracts C = f(x)^(1/3) by dividing D by r.  (Note that\\ndivision can be done mod n without knowing the factors of n, but it\\'s\\nrather complicated.)\\n\\n4. To pay Bob one dollar, Alice gives him (x, C).\\n\\n5. Bob can verify that C = f(x)^(1/3), but he still has to send (x, C)\\nto the bank in order to make sure that x hasn\\'t been used before.\\nOtherwise Alice could spend (x, C) twice.  The bank increases Bob\\'s\\naccount by one dollar.\\n\\nThis scheme is pretty simple and provides untraceability - the bank\\nsaw B and D but not C, so although it can verify that (x, C) is legit,\\nit can\\'t correlate that with Alice\\'s withdrawal.\\n\\nThe main disadvantage of this approach is that Bob has to send (x, C)\\nto the bank right away (or at least before sending Alice anything in\\nreturn for her cash) to verify that the cash hasn\\'t been used before.\\nBut in email, where turnarounds of a day or more aren\\'t unusual, this\\nshould be tolerable.\\n\\nAlice and Bob could be pseudonyms, using anonymous addresses to\\ncommunicate with each other and with the bank.\\n\\nDifferent denominations of cash could correspond to different\\nexponents than \"3\" in the example above.  (That is, $1 would use\\nC=f(x)^(1/3), $2 would use C=f(x)^(1/5), $4 would use C=f(x)^(1/7),\\nand so on.)\\n\\nTechnically, this would be quite easy to implement, using the code in\\nPGP for the arithmetic, and MD5 for the one-way function.  We\\'d need\\nto define a few message formats.  The RFC1113 ascii encoding from PGP\\ncould be used as well.\\n\\nThe \"social\" problems are more challenging, it seems to me.  What is\\nthe backing for this electronic money?  Why do people care what their\\nbank balances are?  Is this stuff really worth anything?\\n\\nOne possibility is to base digital cash on real money.  People would\\nopen a pseudonymous account via email, then postal-mail dollars to the\\nbank, enclosing their account number so the bank would know whom to\\ncredit with the deposit.  Later, if someone wanted to withdraw \"real\\nmoney\" from their account they would have to give a real postal\\naddress where it could be mailed.  Now the electronic money is worth\\nreal dollars.  Even if people didn\\'t deposit or withdraw very often,\\nit still has value because of the backing.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this approach would currently be illegal (at least,\\nunless you actually were a real bank!).  If there were some way the\\nbank itself could be anonymous, it might survive, but I don\\'t see how\\nto mail it money while keeping the anonymity.  Still, we could\\nconsider experimenting with this on a small scale with accounts of no\\nmore than a few dollars.  As long as it was clearly an experiment I\\ndoubt that any prosecutions would result even if it attracted\\ngovernment attention, because the expense involved in court costs\\nwould be so disproportionate to the few dollars involved in this\\ntechnically illegal act.\\n\\nAnother approach would be not to try backing the digital cash at all,\\nor rather backing it implicitly by the determination of various people\\nto accept it and perform services or supply goods in return for it.\\nTim\\'s offer to Xerox papers in return for digital cash would be one\\nexample.  Perhaps others could provide some other services.  It would\\nbe great if some shareware author would accept digital cash as a\\nsymbol of support for crypto anonymity.\\n\\nOne problem that I see with this approach is how you determine the\\nsize of the money supply.  Or, in other words, how does new digital\\ncash get started circulating?  How do people get new accounts, and how\\nmuch money is in them?\\n\\nIf these problems can be solved, a big advantage of this approach is\\nthat the banker can be anonymous.  He would be known only by his\\nanonymous address and his public key(s).  This would provide some\\nsafety in the event that even a small-scale experiment like this\\nwas targetted for a crackdown.\\n\\nAnother issue is the prospect of multiple \"banks\", each issuing their\\nown (incompatible) cash.  How would they compete?  Perhaps in terms of\\nrapid turnaround?  Some might choose to be anonymous, others would go\\npublic.  The latter would have the advantage that people might trust\\nthem more, but OTOH there is more chance of your bank account\\ndisappearing after a crackdown for a public bank than an anonymous\\none.\\n\\nLots to think about here!\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Peter Shipley <shipley@tfs.COM>\\nDate: Wed, 25 Nov 92 12:30:56 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: An easy-to-reply anonymous mail scheme\\nIn-Reply-To: <9211251835.AA23411@novavax.nova.edu>\\nMessage-ID: <9211252030.AA24576@edev0.TFS>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\n>\\n>So to use this, you would generate a public/private key pair, and compute the\\n>hash function of the public part.

The device would have\\nonly one primary function -- the execution of an RSA secret key\\noperation.

No single remailer sees the\\ncorrespondance between your anonymous address and your real address.\\nOnly by breaking all of them can the bad guys find out who you are.\\nIdeally, remailers would operate in a variety of countries with\\ndifferent laws, making it difficult to crack them all.\\n\\nRemailers could be designed to periodically flush themselves, deleting\\nold keys and/or pseudonym maps.  This way anonymous addresses would\\nhave a limited lifetime if desired, and the attackers would have only\\na finite time window to break all the remailers involved.  (Different\\nkeys/pseudonyms could have different lifetimes as needed.)\\n\\nWe could also imagine that there are lots of remailers - not just\\ndozens, or hundreds, but millions of them.  Maybe almost everyone runs\\na \"cheap\" remailer on the side, collecting a few cents in digital cash\\nfor each message they pass, enough to pay for their own messages.\\n\\nPutting all this together, you could have an anonymous address which\\npasses through, say, 10 remailers which might be any of the millions\\nof remailers in the world.  It could have a limited lifetime of only a\\nfew hours for some ultra-sensitive applications, with the remailers\\ninvolved flushing their databases after that time.  To break this, the\\nenemy would have to sequentially break into machines all over the\\nworld, one after another, defeat any physical barriers (locks, men\\nwith guns), overcome tamper-resistance in the computers, break the\\nencrypted files, and find out what the next step is in the address\\ncascade, all in a couple of hours.

This hurts the anonymity\\nof the messages somewhat.\\n\\nWhat PGP actually puts in the cleartext message header is the \"Key ID\"\\nof the recipient.  This is the low-order 64 bits of the RSA modulus\\n\"n\" of his key.  (PGP displays only the low-order 24 bits when it\\nshows key ID\\'s, but it keeps 64 bits internally.)\\n\\nI understand that there was some discussion during the development of\\nPGP 2.0 of having a mode where this wouldn\\'t be done.  One possibility\\nwould be to output a key ID of all zeros for a message which wanted to\\nhide who it was for.  Then, as Peter suggests, it would either be\\ntrial-decrypted by all of the secret keys you have, or, more simply,\\nit would just try your \"default\" secret key.  Most people only have\\none secret key so both methods would be the same in most cases.  Doing\\nit the second way would be a pretty easy patch to PGP.\\n\\nI\\'m not so sure now that this feature is that helpful.  First, you\\ndon\\'t have to put your real name in the \"user name\" field.  You could\\nuse a pseudonym.  So you really don\\'t have to give much information\\naway about yourself the way it is now.\\n\\nAlso, if someone is sending a message to you using encrypting\\nremailers, they would encrypt it using your key, add remailing\\ninstructions for the last remailer in the chain, encrypt that using\\nthat remailer\\'s keys, add remailing instructions for the next-to-last\\nremailer, encrypt it again, and so on.  (This would be done\\nautomatically by some future software - you wouldn\\'t want to do this\\nby hand!)  The result is that the mail you send does not expose the\\nkey ID of your recipient.  That information is only revealed when it\\ncomes out of the last remailer in the chain.  And by that time, it\\'s\\nno secret, since that last remailer is using the true email address of\\nthe recipient anyway.  So it\\'s not giving anything away.\\n\\nFor the other kind of anonymous messaging, where you just post to a\\nnewsgroup or use some other kind of \"broadcast\" system, the key ID is\\nrevealed and for this case it might be better to hide it.  But, the\\nkey ID can be useful in this application by letting you know which\\nmessages you should decrypt.  No one has to know that a particular key\\nID is \"you\".  You can still download 1000 messages and only read yours\\nwithout anyone knowing which ones you read.  But with key ID hidden\\nyou would have to decrypt them all to see which are yours.  Do you\\nwant to decrypt all 1000?  This will take minutes, hours, or days,\\ndepending on your key size and computer speed.  (Most of the decrypt\\ntime is spent doing the RSA step, at least for most messages, and you\\ncan\\'t tell if it\\'s for you without doing that step.)\\n\\nThis still might be a good idea, but I\\'m not sure...\\n\\nHal Finney\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: \"DrZaphod\" <ncselxsi!drzaphod@ncselxsi.netcom.com>\\nDate: Wed, 25 Nov 92 17:59:06 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: RE: PGP on local machine (was Re: MacPGP)\\nMessage-ID: <58809.drzaphod@ncselxsi>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nIn Message Wed, 25 Nov 92 10:30:09 PST,\\n  Eli Brandt <jarthur.Claremont.EDU!ebrandt@netcomsv.netcom.com> writes:\\n\\n>You compose the message, using emacs or some other Turing-complete editor.\\n>You hit the \"PGPify\" key [sequence].\\n>emacs echoes a special START string\\n>The local comm program recognizes it and goes into \"capture\" mode.\\n>emacs blats the plaintext to stdout, where it is captured.\\n>emacs echoes a STOP string.\\n>The comm program sees this, stops capturing, shells to DOS, and runs PGP.\\n>emacs kills the original text block.\\n>(emacs command ends)\\n>The comm program shoves the cyphertext into the uploadt editor to write your messages then\\nyou\\'ve just lost the whole reason for encryption.\\nTTFN!\\nDrZaphod\\n[AC/DC] / [DnA][HP]\\n[drzaphod@ncselxsi.uucp]\\nTechnicolorized\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Wed, 25 Nov 92 16:30:25 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: RS232 Crypto Dongle (idea for widely accessible crypto technology)\\nIn-Reply-To: <9211252337.AA01494@servo>\\nMessage-ID: <9211260030.AA17523@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nPhil K. writes:\\n>My thinking is to limit the external \"dongle\" to the one function that\\n>is truly sensitive and worthy of special protection: RSA secret key\\n>operations.\\n\\nPhil\\'s comment are right on.

As the author of the words you\\ncited in raising your question, and as an advocate of a strict\\ncertification hierarchy, let me respond.\\n\\n\\tIt is clear that one can construct a certification system\\nwhich is not a tree, but rather is a mesh.  The PGP approach is an\\nexample of such a scheme and X.509 permits this.  However, there are a\\nnumber of advantages to a hierarchy which have motivated its use in\\nthe Internet:\\n\\n\\tIn a pure certification mesh, one acquires certification paths\\nby following chins of implied trust.  It is not at all obvious that\\nthis approach scales well.  The PGP folks do not yet have significant\\nexperience in this regard, so it will be interesting to see how the\\nmesh develops over time.  Most folks who have spent considerable time\\nexploring this issue believe that unbounded transitive certification,\\nwith no required name relationships, is a bad idea.  The rationale is\\nthat whatever trust one might accord to an entity may not apply\\ntransitively.  I may give a house key to my neighbor to be able to\\nopen my house under certain circumstances, but that does not suggest\\nthat I would give the key to whomever that neighbor provides his key.\\nIt seems difficult to characterize the nature of trust in these\\n\"lateral\" arrangements and applying trust transitively is even more\\ndifficult.\\n\\n\\tFrom a user interface standpoint, it is generally agreed that\\nmost users are not capable of evaluating a certification path.  In PEM\\nwe feel that a user should know the distinguished name (or an alias\\nassigned by the user locally) of a message originator/recipient, and\\nsome indication of the policy under which the user was certified,\\ne.g., a short-hand name for the PCA.  This is about all we expect a\\nuser to be able to deal with.  The though of a user really paying\\nattention to (much less applying meaningful value judgements to) all\\nof the DNs in a certification path boggles the mind.\\n\\n\\tI won\\'t clain to understand all the details of what PGP\\nprovides for managing key rings.  However, if one were to provide a\\nmanagement tool for mesh certification in general, I think it ought to\\npermit a user to construct a trust graph expressing the relationships\\nimplied by certification paths he acquires.  The user might be able to\\nexpress a degree of trust and a level of allowed transitive\\ncertification for each entity in the graph.  Disply of this info, to\\nallow a user to manage the graph, would be necessary.  All in all, it\\nseems to be pretty complex and it is highly questionable if most\\n(many?) users could make use of this facility without getting\\nconfused.  But, this analysis is based on reasoned speculation, not\\nactual experience.\\n\\n\\tThe naming issues is a related, but somewhat indepedent topic.\\nDNs provide many good features for use with a certification system.\\nOne wants the names to be globally unique and manageable in a\\ndistributed fashion.  Being able to express a through, rich name is\\nimportant if this technology is ever to expand beyond casual use in\\nR&D environments.  Note that DNS names are not great choices.\\nAlthough there are close to a million DNS host names, that represents\\na very small portion of the population that one wants to serve with a\\nsystem like PEM.  Most DNS names are very short and will eventually\\nreuslt in collisions as more individual and organizations are\\nregistered.  The problem is worst in the U.S. where we have adopted a\\nparochial scheme with GOV, EDU, COM, ORG, and MIL at the top, vs.\\nother countries which prefix their DNS names with a country code.\\nWhat\\'s worse is that many DNS indivdiual names are not very mnemonic\\nand thus don\\'t offer much in the way of indentification outside of a\\nvery narrow context.\\n\\n\\tThere is sometimes confusion about the role of certificates.\\nX.509 makes it clear that they serve only for identification, not\\nauthorization.  This is improtant because it is difficult enough to\\nmanage them for identification purposes without overloading\\nauthorization info on them.  Also, the entities who grant\\nauthorization may often be different from those who vouch for the\\nidentity of an individual (or organization) and thus this independent\\nis appropriate.  Often there seems to be a desire to bind more info\\ninto a certificate in support of authorization, but I (and many\\nothers) believe this to be a mistake.  One can construct other\\ncertificates (like the PACs EMCA has defined) to use public key\\ntechnology for authorization, leveraging off of certificates used for\\nidentification.\\n\\n\\n\\tFinally, there is revocation.  We have adopted both a push and\\na pull facility for CRLs in PEM and the PEM CRL format differs\\nslightly from that in X.509.  Many folks fail to appreciate the\\nsubtleties of CRLs at first.  Hot listing on a CRL says that either a\\nkey has been compromised OR a name has changed.  If we have\\nfine-grained, organizationally-related names, then these names will\\nchange with some frequency and thus CRL entries will arise.  Because a\\ncertificate establishes a binding between a name and a key, it seems\\nappropriate that only the entity which vouches for this binding (a CA\\nof some tyep) should be able to revoke it.  That is the model we use\\nin PEM and we add the important feature of having each CA advertise\\nwhen it will issue its next CRL, so that user\\'s know when each CRL\\nthey hold is obsolete.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\tPeter, I hope this note helps explain the very terse words I\\nput in the PEM key management document.\\n\\nSteve\\n\\n------- End of Forwarded Message\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

Several offered help with the hardware/schematics\\ndesign.\\n\\nSome thought that PCMCIA cards would be better for this.\\nTheoretically, yes.  They could contain more memory and processing\\npower in a smaller space.  There are several problems with PCMCIA.\\nFirst, not nearly as many devices have PCMCIA interface as RS232.\\nSecond, you can not make a PCMCIA card yourself, nor can you easily\\nopen it and look what\\'s inside.\\n\\nMy proposed design would consist of only off-the-shelf parts, the\\nschematic would be published, so anybody could build the device for\\nhimself.  I might distribute it in the kit form, which would include\\nall the parts and the PCboard, and a case.  This way, you can test each\\ncomponent in any way you want, and then put the thing together by\\nyourself.  Even if you got the complete unit from me, you could open it\\nup, and look inside.  You could see if it actually corresponds to the\\nschematic.\\n\\nSome people doubted the possibility of its second greatest advantage,\\nthe ability to work with any computer or terminal regardless of\\noperating system, mail software, comm software, etc.  Also it could be\\nused between an ASCII terminal and a (non-trusted) host.\\n\\nHere is an example of a design that I think will work with any\\nsoftware/host/terminal/etc combination.  If I am wrong, please let me\\nknow.  NOTE: this is not the final design of the device, just an\\nexample.\\n\\n=====================================================================\\nSince the device needs to have a processor anyway, it may as well have\\na built-in simple line-mode editor that is good enough for composing\\nmail messages.  So to use the device to send mail, you would:\\n\\n1.  Give the mail command to your host (or BBS) using whatever command\\nor menu selection you normally use to send mail.  Then if the mail\\nprogram puts you into a mode-based editor like vi, enter insert mode\\n(press i or a).\\n\\n2.  Push the \"encrypt\" button on the device (or send a magic sequence\\nfrom your terminal).\\n\\n3.  Type your message in a simple BBS style (in case you have not used\\na BBS, this is the kind of editor they usually use:  You simply type\\ntext. Every line has a number. When you press return, the next line\\nnumber appears.  At the beginning of a line, you can issue commands for\\nexample with a slash or a dot. commands include things like DONE,\\nABORT, DEL LINE, INSERT, etc.)\\n\\nIf you had the text prepared on the local machine, you could simply\\ntransfer the text, and then type the \"DONE\" command.\\n\\nAll this while, the text is only stored in the memory of the crypto\\ndevice, the remote host is still waiting for input.  So plaintext never\\ncrosses the line or network.\\n\\n4.  When you are done, the text would be encrypted (you would select a\\npublic key from the keyring, or it could be automatically determined\\nfrom preceding text (such as the e-mail address).  You would have the\\noption of signing the text.\\n\\nThe device transfers the encrypted text to the host and becomes\\ntransparent.\\n\\nYou then type the command to tell the host that you are finished typing\\nthe message, and off it goes!\\n\\n==========================================================================\\n\\nNow, if you see any reason why the above would not work, please let me\\nknow.\\n\\nA number of people wondered if the tamper-proof memory for private key\\nstorage was necessary.  Some other people wondered if it was in any\\nway effective (i.e. if someone gets the device, they can just use it to\\ndecrypt/sign stuff; so what if they don\\'t get they actual key out of\\nit).\\n\\nI tend to agree. I will have to think some more about this.\\n\\nIt would certainly make the design much simpler (and cheaper, and\\nconsistent with the desire for off-the-shelf parts) if I avoid use of\\nsuch exotic hardware.\\n\\nThe private key may be protected from use by un-authorized users by\\nencrypting it with a key, and requiring it to be entered on a keypad on\\nthe device.

For example, if in my device I have a section of memory\\nthat holds the private key, and I clear it (overwrite with nulls) then I\\ncan be reasonably sure that if someone was to get the device they would\\nnot be able to retrieve the private key from anywhere.  In a machine such \\nas a Wizard, you never know where the number may end up, for example in \\nsome area of memory used for the auto-resume feature or some kind of\\ncache.

Further details will be announced soon when it\\'s stable.\\n\\n\\n--------------------Begin letter----------Begin letter-------------------\\n\\nBefore you get too involved with the client in the comm system I was thinking\\nof a way of having secure privmsgs, two forms depending on how open one chose\\nto be:\\n\\nMessages are exchanged via UDP to hide from the netstat junkies...\\n\\nWhen someone does a msg the first time and the client doesnt know about\\nthat user it queries the server to either get a hostname/port pair for\\nthat user and/or a public key. The data is then stored in an internal\\nattribute bank.\\n\\n   Format of a private message:\\n\\n   ._________________________________________________________.\\n   | Nickname Plaintext     |  dest IP    |  dest udp port   |\\n   | =PGP MESSAGE= =PGP MESSAGE= =PGP MESSAGE= =PGP MESSAGE= |\\n   | =PGP MESSAGE= =PGP MESSAGE= =PGP MESSAGE= =PGP MESSAGE= |\\n   | =PGP MESSAGE= =PGP MESSAGE= =PGP MESSAGE= =PGP MESSAGE= |\\n   `---------------------------------------------------------\\'\\n   [Return host/port/public key are encrypted into the PGP? message]\\n   The above message is then sent to the delivery module of the client.\\n\\n   The above host and port are either the recipeints or the server\\'s depending\\n   on what type of message is being sent. Thus the same message can go to the\\n   server or the recipient direct per se:\\n\\n1) Using the hostname/port + public key for that user the sender\\'s client\\n   encrypts the message and udp transmits a message to that port on the other\\n   users host. That remote client has set up a socket to listen on that udp\\n   port for messages. The remote client unpacks the message with it\\'s private \\n   key and extracts the message, a reply host and port and the senders public\\n   key. He can then reply to the sender and they both can talk without\\n   loading down the server. Plus, unless someone is logging the ethernet,\\n   no one can ascetain wether they are talking. There is only the initial\\n   request of the users public key from the server which each client sends\\n   in automatically when it connects. You might also have an option in the\\n   client to auto download a block/all of the users nicks and their keys so \\n   no-one can detect the initial query of a user.\\n\\n2) The other, differently secure :), form is because the server has been told\\n   to hide the users username + hostname from the /who information. All there\\n   exists for that person is a nickname and a public key. The senders client\\n   gets individually/block downloads the key he wants and proceeds to udp\\n   a message to the server which has the udp port and hostname of the\\n   recipient as normal from the client connect. It acts as IRC does now, as\\n   a middle man for messages. Less secure because the server admin can \\n   ascetain that there is a message being sent between the two people and\\n   also he can slip in his *OWN* keys to basically grab and decipher messages\\n   between the two parties. i.e he sends his own key to the sender and\\n   decrypts the incoming message and then sends the message out to the\\n   recipient using their encryption key. neither user could tell there was a\\n   switch in between. (There are schemes to get past this however).\\n\\nBoth ways have their flaws because you are relying on the non-hackedness of\\nthe server to give you the right keys and hostnames and ports. A bad admin\\ncould easily, knowing enough about coding, disrupt the entire process if we\\ndidnt from the start ensure the right protocols were used. It has to be done\\nright the first time or not at all.\\n\\nI\\'ll echo this letter to a cryptography mailing list to ask for details of\\nschemes that will allow each user to know they have a valid, secure public\\nkey of the other.\\n\\nOne possible solution would be to do a mass query of all the online servers\\nat once and if they didnt report the same keys sound a Real Big Alarm (tm).\\nMaybe an automatom could sit there randomly checking keys :) (Can hear the\\ncries of \"No Bots.. No Bots\" now :).

This entire project constitutes a\\nresearch exercise which will no doubt be written up for publication (at\\nleast online publication, which makes sense culturally given the nature of\\nthe community of interest).  It\\'s research and education.  The amounts of\\n\"digital money\" involved can be utterly miniscule: pennies.  This is a\\n\"token economy\" in the same sense as when psychiatric hospital inmates work\\non the ward for tokens they can trade in for snacks and so on, or a\\nhighschool economics class does a similar exercise using Monopoly-type play\\nmoney.  \\n\\nThis is not illegal any more than any other social science project would be\\nillegal if all the subjects were adults giving informed consent.  Pennies\\nare not a controlled substance nor are they a weapon (unless dropped on\\npeople from high places... :-).  \\n\\nBy analogy I\\'m thinking of the laws against bigamy/polygamy, and a group of\\nadults getting together to study the question of the effects of different\\nkinds of marital arrangements.  So they have a group where they \"pretend\" to\\ncarry out different arrangements and then examine the social dynamics\\nresulting from each.  \\n\\nIt\\'s quite obvious we\\'re all concerned about the larger social impacts of\\nthe possibility of a transition to a cashless economy; and we\\'re\\nhypothesising possible negative consequences and trying to work out\\nsolutions.  That is entirely admirable, and can be presented as such to\\nanyone who cares to listen to the case.  \\n\\nIf this needs any further work to develop research angles, I\\'ll gladly come\\nup with a bunch of surveys and other measures, and we can put them into use\\nand harvest some nifty statistical results which might be publishable in the\\nacademic literature.  \\n\\n-gg\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: George A.

What I preceive it as is a form of IOU\\'s\\nthat if someone does something for you then you send them an applicable\\namount of credits. To simplify it a bank could issue credits and people\\ncould trade in them, sending them back and forth, each digitally encrypted\\nand based on the amount of credits in each persons bank account. I assume \\neach transaction would be validated through a bank to ensure the credit is\\nunique and the right value?\\n\\nE.g:\\n\\n  Customer gets suppliers account number from the supplier encrypted with\\n  the banks public key.  They send it and the amount of cash to transfer to\\n  the bank all encrypted with the public key of the bank. \\n\\n  The bank decrypts, gets the amount and decrypts the destination account.\\n  It then sends a message to the supplier saying that amount has been\\n  deposited in their account and the transaction between the customer and\\n  supplier can be completed. Otherwise it tells the supplier (and customer)\\n  there is a problem with insufficient funds or incorrect data.\\n\\n  The cash may be held in ether until both parties confirm the transaction\\n  has been completed. If the commodity is electronic data the supplier may\\n  send to the bank a transaction private key encrypted with the customers\\n  public key so that the customer cant cheat the supplier as he has to ask\\n  the bank for the information to access his/her data which has been encrypted\\n  with the other half of the transaction keypair. That way the bank knows the\\n  transaction has been completed and it finishes the transfer of funds and\\n  sends the transaction private key to the customer.\\n\\n  Each commodity, especially if it was physical might be serialized so there\\n  could be proof that the customer purchased that item with that SN. If the\\n  merchant was a crook the audit trail would catch him... the customer wouldnt\\n  be able to cheat as the merchant wouldnt have to release the goods (as is\\n  the situation now in Real Life (tm)) until the funds were paid.\\n\\n  Issues of Big Brother spying on your transactions apply here but I guess\\n  one could always use a psuedonym for the electronic commodities and a\\n  postal box paid for with digital anonymous cash for the physical stuff..\\n  (assuming it was mail order... you wont have to give a name for store\\n   buying, just a bank public key and your encrypted account number.)\\n\\n  Someone might even want to set up a physical forwarding company which \\n  merely acts as a buffer for people to increase their privacy.

May)\\nSubject: Cypherpunks List\\nDate: Thu, 26 Nov 92 10:51:01 PST\\n\\nThe Cypherpunks List -- A Thanksgiving Message\\n\\nI guess it\\'s time to say a few words about the \"Cypherpunks\" list,\\nwhich I\\'ve referred to several times in the last few months. Eric\\nHughes, the list administrator and initial organizer of our first\\nmeeting, has also mentioned the group in several places, and the\\nlatest \"Mondo 2000\" actually gives the address, so the information\\'s\\npretty much out by now.\\n\\nWe\\'ve avoided the \"cattle call\" form of invitation, where public\\nannouncements are made and subscribers flood in. But we also haven\\'t\\ngone to the other extreme of requiring some puzzle to be solved (as\\nwith posting to \"alt.hackers,\" which usually requires some hacking of\\nthe posting software to \"get in.\") Cracking a cypher is not a\\nrequirement, though some probably think it should be.\\n\\nA few points:\\n\\n* The name \"Cypherpunks\" started out as a pun by Jude Milhon, an\\neditor at \"Mondo 2000,\" when she said \"You guys are just a bunch of\\ncypherpunks!\" We initially debated calling our informal group\\nsomething more staid like \"The Cryptography Research Society,\" partly to\\nprotect ourselves by emphasizing the \"research\" aspects, but the joke\\nname stuck. So, like it or not, it\\'s \"Cypherpunks.\" It turns off some,\\nturns on others. C\\'est la vie. \\n\\n* Note that we have very little to do with the Gibsonesque vision of\\npunked-out outlaws and virtual reality escapades, though in fact some\\nof our members are active in Bay Area start-up companies doing VR. I\\nwould say Vernor Vinge\\'s \"True Names\" is more descriptive of what\\nwe\\'re doing.\\n\\n* About a hundred or so folks are on the list, including some\\njournalists (gulp!), and even some \"*.mil\" sites (!!). But since what\\nwe\\'re doing is strictly \"research,\" we are of course safe.\\n\\n* The focus is on cryptology, anonymous remailers, hardware support,\\nPGP, digital cash, \"dining cryptographers\" nets, and so on. Too much\\nto recapitulate here.\\n\\n* By focussing on \"research\" into these areas, we feel we are safe\\nagainst attack by government agencies. Time will tell. These issues of\\nsecurity, privacy, remailers, digital pseudonyms, etc., are hot topics\\nin the crypto community, and all we are really doing is applying these\\nideas and doing experiments, the better to learn. (Some of the work on\\n\"webs\" of trust in PGP systems, on issues with anonymous remailers,\\nand on the development of \"digital reputations\" lies in uncharted\\nterritory, that is, we\\'re doing true research.)\\n\\n* Several Extropians are active on the list, as you may have gathered\\nfrom cross-posts and comments.\\n\\n* Because many of the early members live in the Bay Area (Northern\\nCalifornia, Silicon Valley), we\\'ve had three physical meetings so far.\\nJohn Gilmore, a founder of Cygnus Support, has graciously offered his\\nfacilities for our meetings, which typically happen on Saturday\\nafternoons. The schedule gets posted on the list, of course.\\n\\n* Some exciting progress has already been made. Eric Hughes and Hal\\nFinney have implemented a PERL-scripted remailer which provides\\nanonymous forwarding (though the security is only \"manual\"), and 2-way\\nremailers with digital pseudonyms seem imminent. Integrating PGP into\\nmailers remains a problem, as those of you who use PGP already know,\\nand several of our members are working with the PGP and MacPGP teams.\\n\\n* \"Crypto dongles\" to attach to RS-232 ports are being pursued by\\nYanek Martinson (an Extropian as well), George Gleason, John Draper\\n(\"Cap\\'n Crunch\"), and others. Lots of enthusiastic debate.\\n\\n* FIDONet users are also involved, including Tom Jennings, the founder\\nof FIDONet, in 1984. This brings an exciting new flavor for most\\nInternetters. \\n\\n* Like the Extropians list, the Cypherpunks list is relatively free\\nfrom flames and personal attacks. We all realize we\\'re interested in\\nroughly the same goal, even though some are Libertarians (naturally)\\nwhile others are Socialist, Marxists, and Act Up! activists.\\n(Interestingly, we\\'ve never had any real flames on politics. We almost\\nnever argue political views. This may of course be alien to readers of\\nthe Extropians list! :-} )\\n\\n* So why isn\\'t the list sent out in encrypted form? A little thought\\nwill reveal the uselessness of encrypting a widely distributed list\\nthat\\'s essentially open to anyone who sends in a request! Still, there\\nis some talk of encrypting in the future, partly to weed out the\\ncasual readers (for whatever reason) and partly to just get the volume\\nof encrypted messages up.\\n\\nIf you\\'ve read this far, and are really interested in joining the\\nlist, send a request to \"cypherpunks-request@toad.com\". This is\\nstandard list procedure, of course. But please don\\'t then complain\\nabout the list volume!\\n\\n\\n--Tim May\\n\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

It may be useful for the \"crypto\\ndongle\" folks.\\n\\n--Tim May\\n\\n\\nNewsgroups: sci.crypt,comp.arch\\nSubject: 8052-Based Crypto Engine\\nFrom: mmm@cup.portal.com (Mark Robert Thorson)\\nDate: 27 Nov 92 06:50:33 GMT\\n\\nHere is the text from a press release which landed on my desk\\nyesterday:\\n\\nA new microcontroller from Philips Semiconductors-Signetics designed\\nfor use in smart-card applications is the first to incorporate an on-chip\\narithmetic unit optimized to calculate public-key cryptography\\nalgorithms widely used in commercial transactions.\\n\\nThe 83C852 CMOS microcontroller can be embedded in plastic smart cards\\nand provides 2K bytes of on-chip EEPROM for program and data storage\\naccessed under control of the unit\\'s CPU.  \"The new microcontroller removes\\nthe barrier to smart-card use in applications where data security is a\\nconcern,\" said Thomas Brenner, product manager.\\n\\n\"There is strong interest in using smart cards, for example, in medical\\ninsurance or remote banking transactions.  But in such applications a\\nhigh level of data security is indispensable,\" he said.  \"Likewise\\nthe need for secure access codes is a primary consideration for\\ncustomer-card use in the Pay TV and cellular phone markets.\"\\n\\nThe on-chip arithmetic unit running in parallel with the CPU can complete\\na 512-byte calculation in less than 1.5 seconds versus more than a\\nminute to do the calculation in software.  This high-speed performance\\nmakes it feasible to use highly secure and complex public-key\\ncryptography algorithms in everyday transactions.\\n\\nAsymmetric, public-key cryptography uses one key to encrypt and another\\nto decrypt so that only one of the keys need be kept secret.  The other\\ncan be freely distributed.  The method is thus highly applicable to\\ncommercial transactions.\\n\\nThe 83C852 microcontroller is based on the industry-standard 8-bit\\n80C51 processor core and uses the same instruction set.  The circuit\\nincorporates 6 Kbytes of ROM and 256 bytes of RAM in addition to the\\n2 Kbytes of EEPROM.\\n\\nThe EEPROM provides automatic hardware error correction for single-bit\\nerrors in any of the stored data bytes.  After customer software is loaded,\\nelectronic fuses in the array can be blown to limit access to processor\\nfetch commands.  The address bus is mixed to provide further protection\\nagainst fraudulent access and optical scanning, and a low-frequency\\ndetection circuit can guard against external tampering.\\n\\nThe new processor operates from a single 5-volt supply at clock\\nfrequencies up to 6 MHz (1 microsecond instruction cycle).  All voltages\\nrequired during programming or erasure of the EEPROM are generated on chip.\\nNonvolatile data retention is for ten years and the circuit offers an\\ninfinite number of read cycles.  The microcontroller includes a power-on/off\\nreset circuit, and idle and power-down modes.\\n\\nThe microcontrollers can be ordered as a wafer, die on foil or in SO-28\\nsmall-outline packages.  The SO package is available for smart-card\\nreaders and can function as an embedded security module in systems such\\nas restricted access computers.\\n\\nWafer and die-on-foil versions of the 83C852 smart card microcontroller\\nare available now at a unit price of $5.10 and $5.20 respectively in\\n10,000 quantites.  Units in SO-28 packages will be available in\\nfirst quarter 1993 priced at $6.85 in the same quantities.\\n\\nCONTACT:  Thomas Brenner (408) 991-3552\\n\\nHe\\'s with Philips-Signetics.  I have no affiliation with them, so don\\'t\\ncontact me about this part.  If you call Tom, be sure to tell him you\\nheard about the chip from MARK THORSON on USENET.

Even if all the crypto operations were done in the\\ndongle, it wouldn\\'t be a \"turnkey\" device that could operate totally\\nautomatically.  You\\'d still need a way for your host computer to turn\\nit off and on, to select a public key for encryption or signature\\nverification, to load new public keys, etc. I.e., you\\'d have to run\\nspecial driver software on the host anyway. So why not limit the\\ndongle to the specific purpose for which it was designed (protecting\\nyour RSA secret key) and do the less sensitive operations where memory\\nand cycles are far more plentiful, i.e., on the host?\\n\\nLimiting the dongle\\'s function to RSA secret key operations also\\nminimizes the dongle\\'s communication requirements.  The only data\\nyou\\'d have to send to it in normal operation would be short blocks to\\nbe run through your RSA secret key operation, a heavily compute-bound\\nprocess. If I want to decrypt a file, I\\'d send the dongle the IDEA (or\\nDES) key that had been encrypted with my public key. Once the dongle\\nresponds with the decrypted IDEA key, I can perform the actual IDEA\\ndecryption on my host computer with no further dongle interaction.\\nRegardless of the file size, this would go at host CPU and/or disk\\nspeed, not the speed of the port that\\'s talking to the dongle.\\n\\nSimilarly for signing -- the MD-5 hashing of the file would proceed at\\nnear disk speed (since MD-5 is so fast) and only the resulting hash\\ncode would have to be passed to the dongle for the RSA secret key\\nstep.\\n\\nA palmtop DOS machine like the HP-95 or Atari Portfolio would make a\\ngood platform for a prototype dongle.  Most have serial ports\\n(standard or optional), and you could just plug them into a spare\\nserial port on a PC (again, speed is not critical). The palmtop\\'s\\nkeypad would be used to control the dongle, e.g., by accepting a pass\\nphrase to decrypt the stored copy of your RSA secret key, so you\\nwouldn\\'t have to type it into a possibly compromised PC. And they\\'re\\nsmall enough to carry around with you, thus making it harder for\\nsomebody to hack.\\n\\nThe only drawback I can see to all of this is that palmtops are not\\nexactly speed demons, and RSA secret key operations are pretty slow to\\nbeing with (much slower than the public key operations, which are less\\nsensitive). But secret key operations are the heart of RSA, so you\\ndon\\'t have much choice if you want real security.\\n\\nSince it is a sensitive step, RSA key generation could also be done on\\nthe palmtop (although it would probably take hours) or it could be\\ndone on an external, trusted PC and loaded into the palmtop. If your\\nmain reason for using the dongle is to limit the trust you have to\\nplace in a borrowed PC (as opposed to protecting against your own home\\nPC being hacked), this may be a reasonable thing to do.\\n\\nAnother idea just occurred to me. If you have a trusted machine (e.g.\\nyour home PC) available to you over the net, you could use it as a\\n\"remote dongle\". You\\'d send it data to be run through the RSA secret\\nkey operation and it would return it. Obviously, to be secure the\\nnetwork exchanges would have to be encrypted in both directions,\\notherwise anybody could either pick up the \"remote dongle\\'s\" responses\\nor worse, send it data of his own choosing. A simple symmetric cipher\\n(IDEA, DES) would be adequate here since you control both ends of the\\nlink.\\n\\nThe main drawback of this approach (other than the need for network\\nconnectivity) is the physical vulnerability of your unattended home\\nPC.\\n\\nPhil\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: donb@netcom.com (Don Bellenger)\\nDate: Fri, 27 Nov 92 17:11:14 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: Random numbers\\nMessage-ID: <9211280107.AA08614@netcom2.netcom.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n> > \\n> >     It has lately been discussed different ways to construct pure\\n> > random number generators by means of radiactive decay.

The assumption is\\n>that you DON\\'t trust the host.\\n\\nIf you don\\'t trust the host, then why are you running your plaintext\\nthrough it?\\n\\nAs I said earlier, my decision whether to trust a particular machine\\ndepends heavily on how much I would lose if that trust were abrogated.\\nI might be willing to take the chance that this particular borrowed or\\npublic PC has been hacked if the worst that can happen is that the\\nonly slightly sensitive plaintext I\\'m working on at the moment is\\ncompromised. Heck, I might even be signing or decrypting totally\\npublic information, just to help raise the amount of encrypted traffic\\non the net. In this case I might not care at all if my plaintext is\\nsecretly recorded or sent somewhere.\\n\\nBut I would probably NOT be willing to trust the same PC with my\\nsecret key, because it would compromise EVERYTHING I have ever\\nprotected (or will protect) with that secret key. Including THE most\\nsensitive stuff I might have, the plaintext to which I might entrust\\nonly to a RAM disk on my own home PC. Do you understand the\\ndistinction here?\\n\\n>So if the host does not even need to know the dongle exists, it is\\n>automatically independent of what type of computer, operating system,\\n>communications program or terminal you are using.\\n\\nI seriously doubt this will be practical, even with constant\\ninteraction with the dongle\\'s keyboard. Most palmtop keyboards are a\\nreal pain to use, so I would definitely prefer to limit my use of it\\nto truly sensitive things, like typing in my pass phrase to decrypt my\\nRSA secret key, or perhaps hitting a key to re-enable the device after\\nevery N secret key operation requests from the host, or to restart a\\ntimer that would otherwise exit the program and clear RAM after a\\ntimeout in the event the device is lost or stolen.\\n\\n>Again, you are trusting the host.  What if the decryption program on \\n>the host has been modified to quietly write the plaintext to a hidden \\n>file.  \\n\\nAs I said earlier, your \"fully-functional dongle\" fails to prevent\\nthis attack. If it sits on a serial port between your possibly hacked PC\\nand the outside world, then it clearly must pass decrypted plaintext\\nto the PC where it could still be quietly written to disk.\\n\\n>Once the host decrypts the file (at a high speed, as you say), you want\\n>to view the file, right?  That means the plaintext is transmitted from\\n>the host to you.  Anywhere in the link (which could be a simple RS-232\\n>connection, or a chain of network links, modem connections, etc.,\\n>someone may be watching.  With my design, the decryption takes place at\\n>the very last step, just before showing up on your screen.\\n\\nEh? The model I have is a local PC, possibly hacked, with a serial\\nport connected to my personal dongle sitting right beside it.\\nObviously it would not do to have an insecure link between the PC and\\nthe dongle (unless you had encryption on that link, as I suggested in\\nthe case of using a remote machine in place of the dongle.) It should\\nbe fairly hard to inject your own traffic on my 1-foot RS-232 link,\\nespecially if I provide my own cable.\\n\\n>I have thought of that too.  I would need one with two serial ports\\n>though.  If you know of a good, cheap (can something have these two\\n>properties simultaneously? :-) notebook computer with (option of?) two\\n>serial ports, please let me know.\\n\\nThe \"basic dongle\" would only need one RS-232 port, and it would not\\nhave to be fast. This is a definite advantage.\\n\\n>That is just one of the reasons.  The others are convenience, lack of\\n>trust in the host or the network, use of a terminal (which can\\'t run any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThis is the one valid reason I can see for your approach.

But the way we can tell that the key matches the physical person\\nwho we met, is to have it signed by someone we trust.  The signature\\nindicates that \"I certify that this key really does belong to the physical\\nperson identified in the name field\".  Don\\'t sign someone\\'s key unless\\nyou are sure you can make that statement (like, they\\'re standing in the\\nsame room with you and they verify that they key ID matches their real key).\\nDon\\'t sign a key that you received by email or over a modem; it might\\nbe from someone impersonating your friend (when they left their keyboard\\nunattended for a few minutes).\\n\\nPGP works on the model that you specify, for each person on your key\\nring, how much you trust them to introduce you to other people.  For\\nexample, I trust Tom Jennings \"most of the time\", and I got Tom\\'s key\\nfrom him personally.  So I know that if Tom\\'s signature appears on\\nsomeone\\'s key, it probably really is that person.  I\\'ve instructed PGP\\nto know this, too.  I also trust Phil Karn as an introducer, and got\\nhis key from him personally.  PGP knows that if both Phil and Tom have\\nsigned someone\\'s key, that I can believe it *really* is that person.\\n\\nThe people you trust will be the people *you* trust; don\\'t rely on trusting\\nsomeone else\\'s friends.  We are trying to set up an interlocking web of\\ntrusted friends so that even if you don\\'t know me, you will know and trust\\ntwo other people who know me, and can thereby know my key is good.\\n\\nMaking a key distribution system that works on a web of trust is\\nresearch.  It\\'s never been done before.  We\\'d like to give it a good\\ntry, among highly motivated people, to understand how it works and how\\nto improve it.  The alternative we\\'re faced with (e.g. in PEM) is\\nhierarchical systems in which some authority figure signs your key --\\nwith all the attendant possibilities for misuse of power.

The assumption is\\nthat you DON\\'t trust the host.\\n\\nAll these commands to the dongle will be given through the keypad\\nand/or commands you type in from the terminal.\\n\\nSo if the host does not even need to know the dongle exists, it is\\nautomatically independent of what type of computer, operating system,\\ncommunications program or terminal you are using.\\n\\n> process.

Once the dongle\\n> responds with the decrypted IDEA key, I can perform the actual IDEA\\n> decryption on my host computer with no further dongle interaction.\\n\\nAgain, you are trusting the host.

Or you may use different\\ntypes at different times (a terminal at work, a PC connected through\\na modem from home, a firend\\'s Mac, a borrowed laptop using a\\ncellular modem, etc).\\n\\nThe connection could be direct, as in the case of a terminal or\\na direct dial-up by modem.\\n\\nOr the connection could go through multiple channels.  For example\\nyou could dial up a TYMNET POP, and then connect to your host.

Start reading your\\nmail as you usually would.\\n\\nAny time an encrypted message is displayed whose public key ID matches\\none of the private keys on your keyring, the dongle temporarily buffers\\nthe message it into its RAM, flashes the \"decrypt\" LED, while\\ndecrypting the message.  Then you can view the plaintext using a\\nsimple, terminal-independent pager that lets you go forward/back one\\npage, and search for a key word.  When you are done, you press Q, and\\nthe plaintext is immediately deleted from the memory.  Note that during\\nall this, the plaintext did not appear anywhere on the host or any of\\nthe communication links connecting you to it.\\n\\nLet\\'s say you want to reply to a message.  Press \\'r\\' or whatever key is\\nused to reply in your particular mail reader.\\n\\nOr if you want to send a message, press \\'m\\' and fill in the address.\\n\\nThen, if your editor is something like vi or ed that requires you to do\\nsomething before you can input text (like press \\'a\\') then do that.  If\\nyou use an editor like EMACS or SMiLE or jove or cat or anything that\\nlets you just type in text, you skip this step.\\n\\nNow, press the \"encrypt\" button on the dongle.  It presents you with a\\nsimple line editor, that works with any terminal or terminal emulation,\\nbut is reasonably easy to use (something like most bbs-es use for\\ncomposing messages).  You type your message, or if it was prepared\\nahead of time on the local equipment, you transmit the text.\\n\\nNOTE: this is the simpler of the several different approaches to plaintext\\nhandling that I am considering.\\n\\nWhen you are done, you pick the public key to encrypt it with (or it\\ncan be automatically determined based on the address you typed in to\\nyour mail program previously).  If you have lots of public keys, you\\ncould use a search to quickly find the one you want.\\n\\nThen you have the option of signing the message with any one of the\\nprivate keys that you have.\\n\\nFinally, the dongle transmits the cyphertext to the host, and you type\\nthe _exit_ key sequence for the editor (:wq, or C-x C-c, or /done,\\netc).\\n\\nThe message is sent by the mailer software on the host.\\n\\nThen you may want to scan a newsgroup like alt.w.a.s.t.e for any mail\\nthat may be for you.  Put your dongle into \"WASTE SCAN\" mode (for\\nexample by pressing *WS on the keypad) and tell your newsreader\\nsomething like \"display all new messages\".  The dongle will detect a\\nmessage whose key-id matches one of the keys on your key-ring decrypts\\nand displays it, while ignoring all the other messages that are not for\\nyou.  You must retrieve all the messages, so that anyone monitoring\\nyour activity has no way of knowing which one, if any, was actually\\naddressed to you.\\n\\nThen you receive a \"talk\" request (or a chat call on a bbs, or you may\\nbe on irc or a MUD with \"chat mode\") from someone you know has a\\nsimilar device (or software that emulates it).\\n\\nIf you both know each other\\'s public keys, the two devices both\\ngenerate a random session key and encrypt it with the others\\' public\\nkey.\\n\\nIf not, a key-exchange protocol may be used to generate a key both of\\nyou know, but that can not be later recovered by someone recording the\\ndata.\\n\\nNow the dongles encrypt any text (one line at at time) that you type,\\nand decrypt anything received.\\n\\nMany other applications for a portable, trusted crypto engine could be\\nthought of, given time.\\n\\n\\n--\\nYanek Martinson    mthvax.cs.miami.edu!safe0!yanek     uunet!medexam!yanek\\nthis address preferred -->> yanek@novavax.nova.edu <<-- this address preferred\\nPhone (305) 765-6300 daytime   FAX: (305) 765-6708  1321 N 65 Way/Hollywood\\n      (305) 963-1931 evenings       (305) 981-9812  Florida, 33024-5819\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eric Hughes <hughes@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nDate: Sat, 28 Nov 92 10:53:31 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: bounced mail\\nMessage-ID: <9211281853.AA06156@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nWe\\'ve made a small change to the way mail gets sent out to the list\\nwhich should alleviate the bounced message problem.

Some have cited discussion of\\nmilitary cipher systems as being too dangerous for us to discuss,\\nwhile others have expressed some discomfort at the \"anarchist\" flavor\\nof some postings.\\n\\nWell, folks, we all have different axes to grind. Since this is an\\nopen, unmoderated list, little control of content can be expected.\\n\\n* Some want \"cryptography\" downplayed, to be replaced with \"privacy\"\\nas an emphasis. Privacy is seen as more palatable to Americans, less\\nlikely to upset them into cracking down on crypto methods. In other\\nwords, privacy is an easier \"sell\" than secrecy. \\n\\nPerhaps, but why dilute our focus just to make a more digestable pill\\nfor the masses of America, who typically don\\'t think much about\\nabstractions anyway? Those who want to sell \"privacy\" are free to.\\n(BTW, the die was mostly cast when the name \"Cypherpunks\" was\\nadopted. That\\'s already raised red flags, just by the name! If we want\\nto downplay this \"crypto-cyber-punks outlaw\" image, then a name change\\nto something more like the \"Electronic Frontier Foundation\" or the\\nCPSR, nice, safe-sounding names.)\\n\\n* Others have expressed some concern that some minor details of how\\nU.S. cipher machines send out padded traffic were mentioned on this\\nlist--the fear being that discussion of military matters will invite\\nthe scrutiny of the government. Well, check out sci.military some time\\nand see the debate on such issues! Also, many details of the KG-36,\\nKWR-37, and Autodin cipher systems--just to cite the specific military\\ncipher machines that the posting on this list was probably referring\\nto--have already been published, and the Walker spy ring delivered the\\ncomplete specs to these and other machines in the early 1980s.\\n\\nIt\\'s typically only the public who lacks knowledge on these matters.\\nThe Soviets (May They Rest in Pieces) usually got the salient details\\nfairly quickly.  Since ours is a crypto education group--amongst other\\nthings--what\\'s wrong with discussing any of the gadgets and techniques\\nthat numerous books and other postings have already dealt with?\\n\\n(Surely John Gilmore\\'s lawsuit to get some critical crypto papers\\ndeclassified has already \"angered\" the folks at NSA. Are we to censure\\nJohn for stirring up trouble? Of course not. We\\'re free individuals,\\nable to say what we wish, meet in secret meetings without the\\npermission of the government, and learn anything we wish to. This, at\\nleast, is the theory. Until told otherwise, I intend to act on this\\ntheory.)\\n\\n* Some have argued persuasively for concentrating efforts on the more\\npalatable (to the public at large) aspects of crypto techniques, such\\nas authentication to reduce forgeries, privacy protection against\\nillegal eavesdroppers, and so on. This is the \"selling our vision to\\nthe public\" point of view.\\n\\nFine, it is good for some folks to do this, to concentrate on the\\nareas that are unlikely to upset Middle America.\\n\\nBut some of us--and you\\'ve seen my postings--believe the _selling_ of\\nthese ideas of authentication and privacy is a lost cause, or at least\\nis not our main interest (e.g, it\\'s not _my_ interest).\\n\\n* I favor technological solutions over political solutions. Don\\'t call\\nit sedition, call it the natural trend of new technologies. The\\nprinting press broke the power of medieval guilds in ways a political\\napproach could never have done. Same with steam engines, electric\\nmotors, incandescent light, copying machines, computers,\\nmodems...well, you get the point.\\n\\nThe things we talk about on this list, the things being developed and\\ndeployed, will have revolutionary effects. I\\'ve written about these\\neffects over the past several years, and this wonderful list is\\npursuing them all with gusto! The anonymous remailers alone will set\\noff alarms throughout the law enforcement community--you\\'re kidding\\nyourself if you think otherwise. Are we to stop working on anonymous\\nremailers? What about digital cash? \\n\\nFace it, what we\\'re doing will have major implications. To not talk\\nabout these effects, to not speculate on the possible consequences, is\\nto bury our heads in the sand for fear that someone reading this list\\nwill order this list shut down or have us arrested! \\n\\nYes, it\\'s true some journalists are reading this list. Yes, it\\'s\\nfairly likely someone is forwarding this list to various agencies\\n(this isn\\'t paranoia...they\\'d be fools to not know about this list by\\nnow, given the publicity, the reputations of some of us, etc.).

Items\\nMessage-ID: <921128181712_74076.1041_DHJ61-1@CompuServe.COM>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nA few random points related to messages from the last few days.\\n\\n(First, a \"meta\" point - whenever I post to this list, I get from\\n3 to about 10 messages over 2 or 3 days reporting on delivery errors.\\nIt would be nicer if these went to someone else.  Some of the messages\\ninclude as many as 20 or 30 names of list subscribers who were apparently\\nincluded in the same \"outgoing batch\" as the bounced mail.)\\n\\nOn PGP key verification: I understand that Branko hopes to get version\\n2.1 of PGP out in a week or so.  One of the new features will be a\\nmode to display a MD5 hash of each PGP key to facilitate read-aloud\\nover the telephone.  This should make it easier to phone-verify PGP\\nkeys, so we can have more _good_ sigs.\\n\\nOn pseudonyms and reputations: Several people have suggested that it\\nwould be easy to conjure up dozens of fake personalities who would\\nthen vouch for each other, giving the illusion of a well-founded and\\ntrusted pseudonym.  This would be ideal for con men and cops.\\n\\nThis can be defeated by the use of the is-a-person credential, which\\nChaum describes in a couple of his papers, including CACM Oct 1985.\\nThis is a signed document given by an organization which makes you\\ncome in and give your thumbprint.  The document is \"re-blinded\" a la\\nChaums\\' proposals for electronic cash, so that there can be no linkage\\nbetween your is-a-person document and your actual thumbprint.  However,\\nthe thumbprint makes it so you can\\'t get more than one is-a-person\\ndocument.\\n\\nNow, when you go to apply for credit, and you say, here are signatures\\nfrom dozens of people that I\\'ve done business with in the past, and\\nI\\'ve paid them all off on time, the first thing the creditor is going\\nto ask is, who are all these people?  Are they legit?  Can you at\\nleast show me is-a-person creds on them?  You won\\'t be able to.  You\\nonly have one is-a-person credential, and you can\\'t make more.\\n\\nAgain, these credentials do _not_ hurt crypto anonymity.  There is no\\nlinkage between your credential and anything else about you.\\n\\nOn electronic banking: The interesting thing about electronic banking\\nis digital cash.  The key feature of digital cash is anonymity of\\npayments.  There is nothing subversive about this.  Ordinary cash\\nhas (nearly) this property.  Are you being subversive when you buy\\na newspaper without paying by check or credit card?  Of course not.\\n\\nThe point is, we want to use digital payments so that we can transact\\nbusiness over the net.  But the more things get computerized, the more\\npossible forms of monitoring there are, by businesses as well as gov-\\nernments.  There\\'s nothing immoral in trying to keep VISA from knowing\\nwhom I like to do business with.  Digital cash is designed to allow\\nthe convenience of electronic shopping, while keeping the privacy of\\nordinary cash payments.  Conceptually, it\\'s a simple idea.\\n\\nTechnically, what has to be done to turn an electronic banking proposal\\nsuch as Don Bellenger\\'s into electronic cash is some way to make it\\nso that withdrawals can\\'t be paired up with deposits.  You also need,\\nof course, to prevent cheating such as spending the same piece of cash\\ntwice.  It\\'s not trivial to meet these requirements.  The Chaum proposal\\nI described is the simplest one that I know of that achieves this.\\n\\nOn remailers: I haven\\'t yet succeeded in doing a doubly-encrypted\\nremailer test using Bill O\\'Hanlon\\'s and mine.  Once this works, I\\'ll\\npost instructions on how to do this, and possibly a script or two to\\nmake it easier.  With two encrypted anonymous remailers, you can for\\nthe first time send anonymous messages such that no one person can\\nknow whom you are sending to.  Bill and I would have to collude to find\\nout who sent a particular anonymous message.  If more such remailers\\ncan start operating, such collusion will become that much more difficult.\\n\\nOn John Draper: I just wanted to say publically that the famous\\n\"Captain Crunch\" was an inspiration to me when I was in college in the\\n1970\\'s.  Although I did not become a \"phone phreak\" or \"cracker\" he\\nrepresented to me the spirit of questioning authority and exploring\\nbeyond the accepted bounds of the system.  I have followed his career\\nto some extent over the years and I think he has more than paid for\\nany sins he may have committed in his youth.  I for one am thrilled\\nto have the idol of my younger days on the list.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tribble@xanadu.com (E.

Also, it may insert VT100 control sequences as it goes from\\n> page to page in order to clear the screen, etc.\\n\\nIt should not be too difficult to ignore any codes that are not part of\\nthe data stream.  If the message is coded with something like uuencode\\nor base64 then the uniform-length lines of data should be clearly\\ndisinguishable from any other text such as \"Press N for next screen\"\\nor an escape sequence.\\n\\nAlso, overlapping display (some pagers show you a couple of lines from\\nthe previous screenful) could be dealt with by detecting duplicate\\nlines.\\n\\n>> When you are done, you press Q, and the plaintext is immediately\\n>> deleted from the memory.\\n\\n> Well, I\\'d think you\\'d want the option of saving the plaintext to a\\n> file on your PC, not always deleting it from memory.\\n\\nBy memory I meant the RAM in the dongle.

In that case it would also be simple to\\nautomatically use the public key that was used to verify the\\nsignature.\\n\\nI am sure there are other ways.  There is essentially no limit on\\npossibilities once you have a CPU.\\n\\nI will think about it some more.  Thanks for bringing this up.\\n\\n>> simple line editor, that works with any terminal or terminal\\n\\n> I think this is OK, although I\\'m not sure how happy I\\'d be with\\n> your line editor, not being accustomed to using BBS\\'s.\\n\\nYou could probably download an editor of your choice into it.  There\\ncould be several editors available.  Maybe even a simple screen editor\\nthat recognizes several most common terminals like vt100 and ansi.\\n\\n> like I can always compose on my PC, so that\\'s OK.\\n\\nIf your comm software supperted such a feature, the dongle could\\ntransmit a magic sequence which would make the pc to automatically go\\ninto an editor and then transmit the text.  I would imagine eventually\\nthe most popular communication programs would have this feature.  Some\\nmight already.  The point is that if you happen to be using a dumb\\nterminal or some machine or software WITHOUT this capability you could\\nstill receive and send secure messages.\\n\\n>> Then you may want to scan a newsgroup like alt.w.a.s.t.e for any mail\\n\\n>> message whose key-id matches one of the keys on your key-ring,\\n>> decrypts and displays it, while ignoring all the other messages\\n\\n> You might have a buffering problem here.

It would take a fraction of a\\nsecond to determine if that hash matches one of your keys for which the\\nhash values would be precomputed and stored.  Then the message would be\\ncaptured.

It should not be a problem though, if there are not too\\nmany messages for you. I plan for the device to have 256k of ram, so it\\ncould hold a few messages.  The ram could be expanded if necessary.\\n\\n> You can\\'t really anticipate how big the buffer might need to be,\\n> especially if this method of anonymous communication became popular. \\n> As I said in a previous post, you could easily have thousands of\\n> messages  to sort through, with perhaps dozens for you.\\n\\nI envision that this method would only be used for short and important\\nmessages, mostly of the form:\\n\\n  \"Contact me by sending mail to xyzzy@anon-r-us.com, key: dfgSDFgds34DF\"\\n\\nSo they would be short, easy to buffer, quick to decrypt and hopefully\\nnot too many of them.  If there WAS too many messages, more than you\\nwere able to buffer, then it would just ignore the rest, process the\\nones it did get, and then you would request a second scan during which\\nthe first ones (that have already been processed) would be ignored, and\\nthe rest would be received.  The problem with this is that the host\\nwould know that if you scan twice you have a lot of messages. They dont\\nknow which ones though.  Or maybe you just had a transmission error...\\n\\n> solution than just encouraging people to buy laptops and use them? \\n\\nMost people that use e-mail already have a computer, They may not want\\nto buy another one.  They may use the computer or terminal on their\\ndesk for other things too, and would not want the inconvenience of\\nhaving to use a separate screen/keyboard anytime they receive or want\\nto send a private message.\\n\\nLaptop will cost more.  Why buy a screen, keyboard, disk drive if you\\nalready have it.  Hopefully my device will be cheap.  It should be\\ncheaper than any laptop.  All I have is two serial ports, a cpu, some\\nRAM and support cirquitry.  I don\\'t have a full-fledged keyboard,\\ndisplay, disk (or card) drive, and all the other stuff that goes in a\\nlaptop.  \\n\\nLaptops are bigger.  Or if they are small, they have lousy\\nscreens/keyboards.  I hope to make my device smaller than even the\\nso-called \"palmtops\".  It would be easier to carry with you, in your\\npocket.  It would be easier to hide if necessary.\\n\\nYou can\\'t make a laptop.  You cant easily open it up, or if you can, it\\nis complex enough that you can not completely understand its design.\\n\\nYou can make a dongle from a kit, testing each part before you assemble\\nit.

If they match, you\\ncan sign my key with reasonable confidence.\\n\\nAbout the only way to defeat this system is for the bad guy who feeds\\nyou the bogus key in my name to come to my house and hold a gun to my\\nhead as I receive your phone call.\\n\\nI would much rather trust a simple verification procedure based on\\nredundancy and close personal relationships than a single, complex,\\nimpersonal process involving people I don\\'t know. This is not to\\nimpugn your integrity, of course -- I\\'m simply speaking on principle.\\n\\nPeople need to be very selective about the signatures they sign,\\notherwise they will become meaningless. I\\'ve already had people sign\\nmy public key without any verification that it is legit. This is a\\nno-no.  I am bothered by the message that PGP currently generates when\\nit reads in some new public keys asking if you\\'d like to certify each\\nnew key. Even though the default is \"no\", it makes it too easy to sign\\na key without really verifying its authenticity.\\n\\nPhil\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Marc Horowitz <marc@MIT.EDU>\\nDate: Sun, 29 Nov 92 13:27:17 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: crypto dongle design problems\\nMessage-ID: <9211292126.AA22394@deathtongue.MIT.EDU>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nA few comments on \"Detailed Scenario of Dongle Usage\":\\n\\n>> So, you walk up to ANY terminal directly connected to a host, or to a\\n>> terminal server, or a personal computer of any kind connected through a\\n>> modem, or borrow someone\\'s laptop connected to a cellular modem.\\n\\nAs several people have pointed out, terminals are passe\\'.  In general,\\nmy mail never goes over a serial line.  Here at MIT, most people have\\nunix machines on their desks.  Mail is composed on the unix machine,\\nsent via ethernet to the mail hub, and received via POP or NFS from\\nthe mailhub.  To make life worse, often, the machines are in public\\nclusters where anyone can log in.  And, (sit down here), the root\\npassword for these public machines is well known.  (The servers\\' root\\npasswords are a closely guarded secret.)  So, for me, the\\ncrypto-dongle is almost completely useless. \\n\\n>> Call up, or telnet, dial up a bbs, or connect through any other means,\\n>> to your host, and log in.\\n\\nExcept IP.  One of my machine at work runs SLIP over its serial port.\\nWhat am I supposed to do now?\\n\\n>> Any time an encrypted message is displayed whose public key ID matches\\n>> one of the private keys on your keyring, the dongle temporarily buffers\\n>> the message it into its RAM, flashes the \"decrypt\" LED, while\\n>> decrypting the message. \\n\\nSomeone else mentioned this, but I didn\\'t understand your response.  I\\nread mail in emacs, a full-screen editor.  it displays the first\\nscreenfull, and I hit space to scroll down.  Does the dongle recognize\\nemacs and hit space, or what?\\n\\n>> Now, press the \"encrypt\" button on the dongle.

You type your message, or if it was prepared\\n>> ahead of time on the local equipment, you transmit the text.\\n\\nSo, I\\'m trusting the local equipment with my private message.  Even if\\nI\\'m only \"typing directly to the serial port\", how do I know if my\\nfriend\\'s borrowed laptop has been (maybe unknowingly) modified to\\nstore the data?\\n\\nSimilar problems arise with all the other sample applications you\\ndescribe.\\n\\nMore personal comments:\\n\\nI\\'ve had several years of experience designing large-scale systems\\nincorporating security features.  One of the most valuable lessons\\nlearned is that security and privacy must be designed into a system\\nfrom the beginning, not added later.  Ease of use comes from design,\\nnot hacks, which inevitably fail.\\n\\nMy view of a useful crypto-dongle is more like Phil\\'s.  A device with\\none serial port, which stores my private keyring.  It has functions to\\nlist the keys it has (names and hashes, not keys), to decrypt a\\nmessage (while displaying some external indication of having done so),\\nand to sign a message (again, with display).  Programs would have to\\nbe modified to use the dongle to do the appropriate very sensitive\\ncrypto stuff, and I can do the DES or other work on my desktop\\nmachine.  I forsee the dongle being made of a well-known CPU or MCU\\n(easily verifiable), an EPROM (software), a static RAM (long-term,\\nencrypted storage of keys), a DRAM (short-term cleartext storage and\\nbuffering), a UART, an input keypad of some sort, a small (say 1x20\\nLCD display for simple output, and perhaps a special chip for the\\nmath.  Sources to the EPROM would be available, of course.  Paranoid\\npeople could burn their own chip (assuming they trusted the programmer\\n:-).  Yeah, this isn\\'t much use on a dumb terminal, but dumb terminals\\naren\\'t of much use nowadays, anyway.\\n\\n\\t\\tMarc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: mcmahonm@wybbs.mi.org (Mike McMahon)\\nDate: Sun, 29 Nov 92 14:51:00 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: UNSUBSCRIBE\\nMessage-ID: <9211291635.AA01230@wybbs.mi.org>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nunsubcribe mcmahonm@wybbs.mi.org\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Marc Horowitz <marc@MIT.EDU>\\nDate: Sun, 29 Nov 92 13:43:41 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: No Subject\\nMessage-ID: <9211292143.AA22427@deathtongue.MIT.EDU>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n>> This entire business may be pretty simple.

I hope I\\'ll be coherent.\\n\\n** For production use, you want a real, live bank or other entity to\\nissue the \"money\".  Assuming the digital cash is backed by gold, or\\nsecurities, or something else tangible, you don\\'t want the bank to go\\naway with all your money.  Or, if you read in the newspaper \"Feds\\nseize First National Bank\", you want to know if they\\'ve just seized\\n*your* bank, and therefore will be able to watch your deposits and\\nwithdrawals.  If you don\\'t know who your bank really is, you won\\'t\\nknow.\\n\\n** All of the above applies to your escrow agent (who may be your\\nbank) for similar reasons.  Public key systems provide\\nnon-repudiability, but knowing provably that a pseudonym just stole\\nmoney or goods from you doesn\\'t help you get it back.  Sure, it\\ntarnishes their reputation, but if they steal a whole lot of money all\\nat once, they won\\'t care.\\n\\n** Anonymity in banking is a well-known concept.  If I transfer money\\nfrom my numbered swiss bank account to your numbered swiss bank\\naccount, nobody knows anything, except who the bank is.  And I don\\'t\\nsee Switzerland giving up their enviable position in the international\\nbanking community willingly.  All we need to do is convince a swiss\\nbank to do some digital cash banking.  Easier said than done.\\n\\n** Legality of starting our own anonymous electronic bank: what do the\\nlaws say, anyway?  As long as I pay taxes on any profit, I can form a\\nsole proprietorship to freely buy and sell purple widgets with very\\nlittle government interaction.  Would it still be legal if I got a\\nwhole lot of people to accept purple widgets instead of cash?  Would\\nit be legal if we called it \"digital purple widgets\" instead of\\n\"digital cash\"?\\n\\n\\nI\\'d really like to see some sort of digital cash system set up.  My\\nfeeling is that there would be a stronger demand than most people\\nthink for such a thing, even if it weren\\'t anonymous and untraceable\\nand all that.  But if it has those features, too, and we do it first,\\nit will get used.  And de facto standards are hard to get rid of.\\n\\n\\t\\tMarc\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: S950272@slvaxa.umsl.edu\\nDate: Sun, 29 Nov 92 15:19:41 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Please...\\nMessage-ID: <01GRQCRO6QHG8WW8IZ@slvaxa.umsl.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nPlease delete me from the mailing list, the mail volume is too great for me.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Marc Horowitz <marc@MIT.EDU>\\nDate: Sun, 29 Nov 92 15:25:14 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: unsubscribe messages\\nMessage-ID: <9211292324.AA22516@deathtongue.MIT.EDU>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nIf you don\\'t want to be on this list, that\\'s fine.\\n\\nBUT PLEASE STOP CLUTTERING MY INBOX WITH THE UNSUBSCRIBE REQUESTS!!!

Thus the same message can go to the\\n   server or the recipient direct per se:\\n\\n1) Using the hostname/port + public key for that user the sender\\'s client\\n   encrypts the message and udp transmits a message to that port on the other\\n   users host. That remote client has set up a socket to listen on that udp\\n   port for messages. The remote client unpacks the message with it\\'s private \\n   key and extracts the message, a reply host and port and the senders public\\n   key. He can then reply to the sender and they both can talk without\\n   loading down the server. Plus, unless someone is logging the ethernet,\\n   no one can ascetain wether they are talking. There is only the initial\\n   request of the users public key from the server which each client sends\\n   in automatically when it connects. You might also have an option in the\\n   client to auto download a block/all of the users nicks and their keys so \\n   no-one can detect the initial query of a user.\\n\\n2) The other, differently secure :), form is because the server has been told\\n   to hide the users username + hostname from the /who information. All there\\n   exists for that person is a nickname and a public key. The senders client\\n   gets individually/block downloads the key he wants and proceeds to udp\\n   a message to the server which has the udp port and hostname of the\\n   recipient as normal from the client connect. It acts as IRC does now, as\\n   a middle man for messages. Less secure because the server admin can \\n   ascetain that there is a message being sent between the two people and\\n   also he can slip in his *OWN* keys to basically grab and decipher messages\\n   between the two parties. i.e he sends his own key to the sender and\\n   decrypts the incoming message and then sends the message out to the\\n   recipient using their encryption key. neither user could tell there was a\\n   switch in between. (There are schemes to get past this however).\\n\\nBoth ways have their flaws because you are relying on the non-hackedness of\\nthe server to give you the right keys and hostnames and ports. A bad admin\\ncould easily, knowing enough about coding, disrupt the entire process if we\\ndidnt from the start ensure the right protocols were used. It has to be done\\nright the first time or not at all.\\n\\nI\\'ll echo this letter to a cryptography mailing list to ask for details of\\nschemes that will allow each user to know they have a valid, secure public\\nkey of the other.\\n\\nOne possible solution would be to do a mass query of all the online servers\\nat once and if they didnt report the same keys sound a Real Big Alarm (tm).\\nMaybe an automatom could sit there randomly checking keys :) (Can hear the\\ncries of \"No Bots..

Nobody seems to have hard evidence on\\nthis.  On the one hand, people can legally exchange certain types of\\nsecurities, and they could perform services for each other in return\\nfor such exchanges.  This is legal, but they are supposed to report\\nthe income on their tax returns.  Our digital cash would seem to fit\\nthis model.  (But are such securities transfers as untraceable as\\ndigital cash?  Perhaps not.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, I read several years ago that casino chips in Las\\nVegas were starting to be used as cash substitutes, but that the\\ngovernment cracked down on this practice.  Perhaps this was too\\nconducive to money laundering, especially with the reputed underworld\\nactivity in that city.\\n\\nI do think, though, that an informal digital cash system, presented as\\na research project or an educational game, would be able to slip\\nbetween the cracks of the legal system, much as PGP has done.

Any bank deposit which the depositor may demand\\n(withdraw) at any time in contrast to time deposit which requires\\ndepositor to wait the specified time before withdrawing or pay a\\npenalty for early withdrawal.  Funds accepted by bank subject to\\nimmediate withdrawal; such represent largest element in money supply\\nof the United States.\\n\\nCertain mutual funds which have checks available to them do not fall\\nunder this classification.  Such a mutual fund might be said to have\\ndeposits, but they are not demand deposits.  You can\\'t get them\\nwhenever you like.  The fine print of such aggreements states that the\\nmutual fund company does not have to honor the check for up to thirty\\ndays, typically.  Because of the time delay, such deposits are not\\npayable on \"demand.\"\\n\\nMutual funds, though, since they are backed by securities, do fall\\nunder securities law.  \\n\\nAgain, from Black\\'s:\\n\\nFor purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange\\nAct of 1934, the term \"security\" embraces all investment contracts,\\nand the test is whether the investment is made in a common enterprise\\nwhich is premised upon the reasonable expectation of profits solely\\nfrom the managerial or entrepreneurial efforts of others; such test\\ncontains three elements: the investment of money; a common enterprise;\\nand profits or returns derived soleley from efforts of others.\\n\\nI merely pointed out that if you\\'re not a bank, you\\'re not under\\nbanking regulation.

I don\\'t even know who the sysadmin is on the system where I\\nrun the remailer.  They don\\'t know anything about it.  Eric\\'s\\nremailers don\\'t require continual processes to be run, root\\nprivileges, hacking the mail tables, or anything special.\\n\\nAll you need is to be on a Unix system which supports the \".forward\"\\nfile.  This is typically implemented by the mail programs which\\ndeliver mail to the user\\'s mail file.  The programs check to see if a\\nfile called .forward exists in the user\\'s home directory, and if so\\nthey treat its contents as either a program to pipe the incoming mail\\ninto, or a user name or list of user names to send the mail to.\\n\\nThis is the hook by which Eric\\'s remailers operate.  The .forward file\\nis set up so that mail is piped to a program which sorts the mail\\nbased on its headers, using the mh utility slocal or, in my case, a\\nperl script which provides some of the same functions.  Each message\\nis checked like this, and if it doesn\\'t contain any of the special\\nstuff which activates the remailer software, it is simply deposted in\\nthe user\\'s mailbox file as usual.  Otherwise the remailers run and\\nforward it as requested.\\n\\nWith this solution, there\\'s no need for anybody to be aware that you\\nare running a remailer, as long as it\\'s not too much of a load in\\nterms of extra message traffic.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: S.E.

People would\\nhave to scan the bit patterns back in, which would be inconvenient.\\n\\nHow big will a piece of digital cash be?\\n\\nAn electronic \"dollar bill\" in the simple scheme of Chaum\\'s consists\\nof two parts:  (x, f(x)^(1/e).  X is a random number, f(x) is a one-way\\nfunction like MD5, and e is the exponent which could be taken to represent\\nthe denomination of the bill.  MD5 takes 64 bytes as an input \"chunk\"\\nso that would be a natural size for x.  f(x)^(1/e) is f(x) \"signed\" by\\nthe bank using exponent e, so that would be about the size of the bank\\'s\\nmodulus n, say 1024 bits or 128 bytes.  Probably there would be some\\ncontrol information as well.  So the total size of an electronic banknote\\nwould be 128 + 64 + a few, or about 200 bytes, maybe a little more.\\nTo print this you\\'d have to Ascii-encode it, which generally expands\\nthings by 1/3, so you\\'d get about 270 to 300 characters per bill/coin.\\nThis would be around four or five lines of text, comparable to a PGP\\nkey (and looking about as interesting - totally jumbled letters and\\nnumbers).\\n\\n\"Forgery\" is in one sense hard and in one sense easy.  It\\'s hard because\\nto create new dollar bills because you have to forge a signature using\\nthe bank\\'s public key (n, e).  This is equivalent to breaking at least\\nsome uses of RSA.\\n\\nBut it\\'s easy to reproduce existing electronic dollars, and you don\\'t even\\nneed a Xerox machine.  Just \"copy dollar1 dollar2\" on your PC, and repeat\\nthe process.  Presto, plenty of dollars, all exactly the same.  Send one\\nto the butcher, one to the baker, and you\\'ve still got plenty more\\nwhere those came from.\\n\\nKeeping this kind of re-use from occurring is one of the things that\\nmakes electronic cash tricky.  Chaum\\'s simple scheme has the receiver\\nof cash calling the bank or sending the cash there right away.  The\\nbank has a list of \"serial numbers\" for all the cash that\\'s ever been\\ndeposited, which it compares against to see if this is a re-use.  The\\nfirst person to deposit a dollar with a given serial number gets credit\\nfor it; the others are told that it\\'s worthless.\\n\\nAnother area that people seem a little unclear about is the difference\\nbetween electronic cash and electronic checking accounts.  A checking\\naccount could be managed by simple RSA-signed messages (e.g. created with\\nPGP) saying, please transfer $X.00 to account number XYZ.  If you wanted\\nto buy something from someone, you\\'d find out what his account number\\nis with the bank, write up a little note like this, sign it using your\\npublic key with PGP, and email it to the person that you wanted to buy\\nfrom.  He\\'d send it on to the bank and his account would get credited.\\nAgain, you\\'d want to put a serial number on your check so that the guy\\ncouldn\\'t send it again tomorrow and get another $X.00.\\n\\nOr, you could just send it directly to the bank and request the bank to\\nnotify the seller that the funds had been transferred.  This would seem\\nto avoid the re-use problem.\\n\\nThe difference between this system and electronic cash is that the bank\\nknows exactly what is going on.  It sees all transactions, so it knows\\nwhich accounts are making payments to which other accounts.  This is\\ntrue of ordinary paper checking accounts as well, of course.\\n\\nElectronic cash is designed so that not even the bank can tell who is\\npaying whom.  I withdraw some cash, say, $100.00, and I pay you $35.00\\nby mailing you the electronic bills.  You deposit them.  The bank has\\nno way of determining which particular withdrawal produced those bills\\nwhich you are depositing.  This is, more or less, how real cash works.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

That\\'s\\ngreat, but that version of PGP isn\\'t here quite yet. I suspect, in\\nany case, that the added security isn\\'t all that great since I suspect\\nit\\'s very hard to find another valid key-pair where the public key\\nmatches the last 24 bits plus some fragment of another 20 bits or so\\nfrom the middle of the key.\\n \\nPhone, as opposed to mailed paper verifications has the following\\nproblems:\\n \\nPhil says you have to recognize the voice, which implies you\\'ve met\\nhim in close quarters, which implies you could have exchanged keys\\nphysically anyway.  If the only place you\\'ve heard the voice is\\nover the phone, that\\'s not a very good criterion.\\n \\nPhone verification is good, IMHO, *only* if the person being verified\\nis *called at a listed number*. You can\\'t verify a person who calls you,\\n(unless you know the voice).  You can\\'t verify a person you call at\\nan unlisted number which you got over the net!!\\n \\nEconomics: Net participants are scattered over the country and even the\\nworld. Paper verification costs about $2-$3 allowing for my fee, copying\\ncosts and two-way international postage. Adding notarization adds about\\n$5.00.  Phone verification is economical locally (maybe cheaper than\\nmail), but more expensive when long-distance rates apply, especially\\ninternational rates.\\n \\nMeeting at parties or face-to-face is most expensive of all, unless\\nthe meeting happens fortuitously. Overseas plane fare to exchange keys\\nis beyond the means of most of us.\\n \\nPhil says:\\n \\n    I would much rather trust a simple verification procedure based on\\n    redundancy and close personal relationships than a single,\\n    complex, impersonal process involving people I don\\'t know.  This\\n    is not to impugn your integrity, of course -- I\\'m simply speaking\\n    on principle.\\n \\nNo offense taken!  I, on the other hand, would rather have in my hand\\na signed statement of identity with photocopied ID that I can keep\\nand file away.  I also don\\'t want to go broke making international\\nphone calls.\\n \\nAs it happens, I, so far, have not been able to sign a single key!!\\n \\nI called Phil Zimmerman at a listed number, I read him my key and\\nhe signed it, but he was called away from the phone before he could\\nverify his key to me. So I can\\'t sign his!\\n \\nI\\'ve met a few people at parties I\\'ve given my paper key (fragments)\\nto. So far none of them have signed my key, but none of them had\\npaper key fragments to trade, so I can\\'t sign theirs.\\n \\nGeorge Gleason commented about supplying home addresses.  Your\\ncomments are well taken. Phil Zimmerman also commented to me in E-mail\\nthat some people don\\'t want the serial numbers on their photo ID\\ncopied.  Everyone please feel free not to supply a home address and\\nto obscure any home address or serial number on the photocopied\\nphoto ID. I\\'ll still sign your key, although I\\'ll note what you did\\nin my signed key directory, which I\\'ll send to customers & publish\\nhere.  If you don\\'t want *me* to know your home address, you can\\nuse a P.O. box for me to return my (or other customers\\') ID\\ncertificate(s) to you. On the other hand, as the service provider,\\nMY home address and phone are public info.\\n \\nI also acknowledge George\\'s criticism re the \"I\\'m not a cop\"\\nstatement. I\\'m going to leave it in my statement, because it\\'s\\ntrue, but in general you should be aware that any legal protection is\\nquestionable at best.  The lack of protection has been verified by\\na source on Extropians and by an attorney on the RIME network.\\n \\nIn the meantime, I guess we can discuss illegal subjects not with\\n\"I\\'ve done ...\" but with \"I\\'ve heard that ...\" or \"I used to know\\nsomebody who ...\". Also anonymous remailers will be a big help.\\n\\n--\\nedgar@spectrx.saigon.com (Edgar W.

She hashes x to yield fx\\nx = 3141526535\\nr = 5772156649\\nfx = 2718281828\\n\\nHere, I just picked the value of the hash function from the  \\nmathematical air, so to speak.\\n\\nAlice computes B = r^5 fx mod n\\n = (5772156649^5 2718281828) mod 4153749073821763621\\n = 592088213321408342 \\n\\n\\n-> B = PowerMod[r^5 fx, 1, n] in Mathematica\\n\\nAlice sends B to the bank.\\n\\n2) The bank takes fifth root of B.  Or, it raises B to the power that  \\nis the inverse of 5 mod n.\\nTo find the inverse of 5 mod n, compute\\ninv1 = 5^(-1) mod phin = 5^(-1) mod 4153749069745613932\\n = 1661499627898245573\\n\\nThe bank can do this since it knows the factorization of n.\\n\\n-> inv1 = PowerMod[5, -1, phin] in Mathematica\\n\\nSo, to take the fifth root:\\nD = B^inv1 mod n \\n\\n = (592088213321408342 ^ 1661499627898245573) mod 4153749073821763621\\n = 1189395596986402260\\n\\n-> D = PowerMod[B, inv, n] in Mathematica\\n\\nJust as a check: D^5 mod n = \\n\\n = (1189395596986402260 ^ 5) mod 4153749073821763621\\n= 592088213321408342 = B     So we\\'re OK.\\n-> Mod[D^5, n] in Mathematica\\n\\nBank sends Alice D.\\n\\n3) Alice extracts C by dividing D by r.  Or, she solves the following  \\nequation for C:\\nD = C r mod n, or\\n1189395596986402260 = C 5772156649 mod 4153749073821763621\\n\\nThis can be solved by multiplying D by the inverse of r mod n, and  \\ntaking the result mod n.  You don\\'t need to know the factors of n.   \\nAs a technical note, there will be only one solution since GCD[D,n] =  \\n1, which is usually true since n only has two factors p and q.  The  \\nbank is in trouble if GCD[D, n] != 1 since that means n can be  \\nfactored by the information in D.\\n\\ninv2 = r^(-1) mod n\\n = 5772156649 ^ (-1) mod 4153749073821763621\\n = 3900656075651054436\\n\\n-> inv2 = PowerMod[r, -1, n] in Mathematica\\n\\nSo, C = (D inv2) mod n\\n = (1189395596986402260 3900656075651054436) mod 4153749073821763621\\n = 3844350519262422248\\n\\n-> C = Mod[D inv2, n] in Mathematica\\n\\nJust as a check: C r mod n = \\n\\n = (3844350519262422248 5772156649) mod 4153749073821763621\\n = 1189395596986402260 = D     So we\\'re OK.\\n-> Mod[C r, n] in Mathematica\\n\\nSo now Alice has\\nx = 3141526535 and\\nC = 3844350519262422248\\n\\n4) Alice pays Bob by giving him (x, C)\\n\\n5) Bob verifies that C = fx ^ (1/5) mod n.  Or, he verifies that fx =  \\nC^5 mod n\\nC^5 mod n = \\n\\n = 3844350519262422248 ^ 5 mod 4153749073821763621\\n = 2718281828\\n\\nwhich does indeed equal f(3141526535) = 2718281828 where f is our  \\nhashing function.  So Alice isn\\'t cheating by sending a bogus (x, C)\\n\\nBut Bob must also send (x, C) to the bank to verify Alice isn\\'t  \\ntrying to spend the money more than once!\\n----------------------------------------\\n\\nSo there it is, with numbers and Mathematica statements for those who  \\nhave access to Mathematica.  Hopefully, the numbers are large enough  \\nto convince people it didn\\'t work out by chance.\\n\\nNow, the code to perform the math must be written, as well as the  \\nscripts to support the bank.  Has anyone used the RSAREF routines, or  \\nshould we stick to what\\'s supplied with PGP?  I haven\\'t thought that  \\nfar ahead.  Like I said earlier, I\\'ll pick up work on this in a few  \\nweeks.\\n\\n---\\n/-----------------------------------\\\\\\n| Karl L.

We present a recently discovered\\nnineteenth-century manuscript about these functions, which in part\\nbecause of their applications in cryptology, have received\\nconsiderable attention in contemporary computer science research.\\nAttributed to the little-known yet highly-suspect\\ncomposer/mathematician Maria Poopings, the manuscript can be sung to\\nthe tune of ``Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious\\'\\' from the musical\\nMary Poppins.  In addition, we prove three ridiculous facts about\\nsuperpolylogarithmic subexponential functions.  Using novel extensions\\nto the popular DTIME notation from complexity theory, we also define\\nthe complexity class SuperPolyLog/SubExp, which consists of all\\nlanguages that can be accepted within deterministic\\nsuperpolylogarithmic subexponential time.  We show that this class is\\nnotationally intractable in the sense that it cannot be conveniently\\ndescribed using existing terminology.  Surprisingly, there is some\\nscientific value in our notational novelties; moreover, students may\\nfind this paper helpful in learning about growth rates, asymptotic\\nnotations, cryptology, and reversible computation.\\n\\nKeywords.

TTFN!\\n\\nWell,\\n\\nI intend for the communications themselves to encrypted as well.  This\\nwould call for the remailing request to also somehow include Alice\\'s\\npublic key, and Bob\\'s communications to include his public key, etc.\\nThis will prevent intercepted mail from tampering and keep the\\nanonimity.  .  Possibly the bank will have two public keys: one for\\nmoney, and one for mail.\\n\\nHowever, in the initial phase to keep things simple, the messages\\nwon\\'t be encrypted - only the remailing info will.  This will\\nimplement the anonymous part, and allow transactions, but will provide\\nno protection against intercepting mail, etc.  Heck, the initial\\nsystem will only allow withdrawals and deposits of a constant\\ndenomination, so I\\'ll worry about spoofing later :-)\\n\\nI\\'m operating under the premise of getting something out that is\\nusable but not full blown.  So extra denominations, fully encrypted\\nmessages, etc. will be added later.\\n\\nAlso, I received a mail from rjc@gnu.ai.mit.edu (Rob Crowley?) - whose\\nmail I seem to have misplaced - voicing concern over proving deposits in\\nthe event that the bank can\\'t be trusted.  Any of the digital currency\\nprotocol articles discuss this issue?

The numbers looked right.  One point is that doing\\ndifferent denominations isn\\'t that much harder, you just need to have\\nmore exponents.  As you generate your primes p and q, make sure that\\np-1 and q-1 aren\\'t divisible by any small primes (other than 2).  This\\nwill ensure that phi = (p-1)(q-1) is not divisible by small primes, hence\\nthat gcd(e, phi) will be 1 for those same small primes, in fact for\\nall the odd numbers.\\n\\nKarl also quoted a comment from Ray Cromwell expressing concern over\\nproving deposits.  Ideally you\\'d get a signed receipt from the bank\\nfor every deposit you make.  In the case of electronic deposits, there\\nexist protocols for \"gradual secret exchange\" that might be suitable\\nfor this purpose.  What you\\'d like is to send the bank your deposit\\n\"gradually\", while the bank simultaneously gradually sends you a\\ndigitally signed receipt.  I don\\'t recall the details of these\\nprotocols.  Gradual exchange would not be very convenient for email\\nbecause of the long turnaround times in mail systems, but if you had a\\nbetter connection it might be useful, especially for large deposits.\\n\\nAnother way to look at it is, what stops the local merchant from\\ntaking your payment, putting it in his pocket, and then denying that\\nyou\\'ve given him anything?  It would just be his word against yours.\\nOne answer is, if he does that to multiple people, their multiple\\nstories would have more credibility than his denials.  Similarly, a\\nbank which made a habit of cheating its customers would find itself\\npublically exposed.  So it may be reasonable to trust the bank for\\nroutine transactions.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: fnerd@smds.com (FutureNerd Steve Witham)\\nDate: Thu, 3 Dec 92 15:36:23 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: understandable cypher software\\nMessage-ID: <9212032155.AB19933@smds.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nFolks--\\n\\nA paragraph of philosophy and then some technical PGP questions.\\n\\nI should be able to verify with my own eyes how cypher technology works.  \\nOtherwise I\\'m trusting my security to somebody\\'s black box.\\nI should be able to write my own and test that it interacts with someone \\nelse\\'s the way it\\'s supposed to.

I can give some pointers here to answers to\\nsome of the questions people have asked.\\n\\nSteve Witham asks several questions.  I think the crypto glossary\\nwhich Tim posted a couple of weeks ago tells how RSA works, so I won\\'t\\nreiterate that here.  Steve, if you didn\\'t get it, maybe Tim could\\nsend it to you.\\n\\nPGP\\'s signature algorithm creates an MD5 message digest of the\\nmessage, then signs that digest by raising it to the secret exponent\\n\"d\", mod \"n\".  MD5 is a public-domain message digest algorithm created\\nby RSA Data Security, Inc, which breaks messages into blocks of 64\\nbytes as input and produces a 16-byte (128-bit) digest.  PGP then pads\\nthis 16-byte number to be about the size of n, and does the\\nexponentiation.\\n\\nPGP does not do its decryption/signature exponentiation by actually\\nraising the number to the power of d mod n, but by doing a\\nmathematically equivalent operation involving two exponentiations, one\\nmod p and one mod q.  Since p and q are half the length of n, and\\nexponentiation takes roughly the third power of the number of bits in\\nthe modulus, this reduces the amount of time by a factor of 4.\\n\\nThe random number generator has several different modes, and I can\\nonly suggest looking at random.c.\\n\\nThe data-compression algorithm is not really relevant but is based on\\nzip.  The binary-ascii translator is also not important but is a\\nvariant on the PEM standard.\\n\\nSteve asks a lot of questions about the speed of different versions.\\nMaybe asking on alt.security.pgp would produce some representative\\nvalues.  I\\'m not sure whether anyone has a database with all these\\nnumbers.\\n\\nI understand that PGP 2.1 may have a faster version of the Upton\\nmodmult.  Preliminary timings suggest that it\\'s still slightly slower\\nthan the Merritt modmult on the Sparc, but if Merritt really is\\nunreliable (I haven\\'t heard about this) then switching to Upton will\\nnot involve much of a penalty.  PGP is very fast on Sparcs anyway and\\nI don\\'t think making it 10% slower would matter.\\n\\nProfiling indicates that yes, during the RSA encryption phase, most of\\nthe time is spent in modmult.  An interpreter could be built to do a\\nmodular exponentiation using a C implementation of modmult and it\\nwould be about as fast.  However, that still leaves the generation of\\nthe random session key, padding it with random numbers so that it is\\nsuitable for RSA operations, converting the RSA-encrypted session key\\ninto a format suitable for writing to a file, doing the IDEA\\nencryption, wrapping this all up with control information so that it\\ncan be decrypted, looking up key information from a key ring file or\\nsome other data file (possibly decrypting it on the fly), converting\\nto ASCII, etc.  All these are part of an encryption/decryption cycle\\nand can\\'t really be skipped.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: ghsvax!hal@uunet.UU.NET (Hal Finney)\\nDate: Fri, 4 Dec 92 10:03:39 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: Weakness of the PGP scheme ?\\nMessage-ID: <9212041755.AA17036@nano.noname>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nVanguard@gribb.hsr.no asks about trying all the IDEA keys.  If you\\nwill look in idea.h you will see that the IDEA key is 16 bytes long,\\nwhich is 128 bits.  This is long enough to make trying them all\\nimpossible.  Trying to predict one IDEA key by knowing the previous\\none also looks hard, as PGP basically cycles IDEA on random input and\\ntakes the output as the keys.  If you could predict this output it\\nwould be similar to breaking IDEA.\\n\\nOn the other hand, PGP normally keeps its random information in a\\nsmall file called randseed.bin.  It uses the contents of this file\\nplus the current time of day in seconds as the input to generate the\\nIDEA key.  If you stole this file from someone (it\\'s not\\ncryptographically protected, unlike the secret key ring), and you know\\nwithin several hours or a day when he sent each message, you could\\nprobably calculate all possible IDEA keys in a feasible amount of time\\n(by trying all plausible values for the time of day in seconds).  This\\nwould also let you calculate the new contents of the randseed.bin\\nfile.  As long as you didn\\'t miss any messages he sent, you could keep\\ndoing this and break all of his outgoing messages.\\n\\nYou can prevent this by removing your randseed.bin file and\\nsubstituting an empty file (or one that is less than 16 bytes long) in\\nits place.  This will cause PGP to prompt you for random keyboard\\ninput each time you send a message, which would make it impossible for\\nthe attack above to work.  It would mean less convenience, though.\\n\\nThe relevant routines are make_random_ideakey() and\\nstrong_pseudorandom() in crypto.c, as well as the code in random.c.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserv.ecom\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: edgar@spectrx.Saigon.COM (Edgar W.

As Hal Finney said, the two\\nprimes should be \"good\" in the sense that p-1 and q-1 have no small\\nprime factors.  Obviously, you can\\'t avoid having 2 divide p-1 and\\nq-1, but that should be about it.  Also, p and q should differ in\\nlength by a few digits otherwise an enemy may begin to try factoring n\\nby starting near sqrt(n).\\n\\nPick a decryption exponent d.  d and phi(n) should be relatively\\nprime, where phi(x) = Euler totient function = # of numbers less than\\nx which are relatively prime to x = x-1 for x prime.  For n, phi(n) =\\n(p-1)(q-1).  Calculate the inverse of d mod phi(n) and call it e, your\\nencryption exponent (e = d^(-1) mod phi(n)).  Publish n and e as your\\npublic info, and keep d secret as your decryption key.\\n\\nSomebody encrypts a message by calculating M^e mod n.

This only makes sense if RSA were inherently much\\nfaster than IDEA.

(A personal\\nnote: I\\'m blissfully PERL-illiterate, but I use Mathematica on my Mac,\\nso Karl\\'s examples in Mathematica overjoyed me!)\\n\\n6. Several weeks ago I posted some articles on the dining\\ncryptographers protocol, as Hal also did. I can send these to anyone\\nwho wasn\\'t on the list then. (Ditto for the Crypto Glossary.)\\n\\n7.

The problem is, with a single-remailer anonymous\\naddress that remailer sees whom each anonymous address corresponds to,\\nso you have to trust it.  Now that other encrypting remailers are up\\nit\\'s possible to have anonymous addresses which go through more than\\none remailer before going to the final destination.  This, I thought,\\nwould provide a more secure address since a whole group of remailers\\nwould have to be \"broken\" in order for someone to find out where a\\ngiven anonymous address leads.\\n\\nHowever, with the current implementation, there is a security\\nweakness.  Whomever owns the last remailer in the chain for your\\nanonymous address can find out who you are.  They do this simply by\\nsending an anonymous message with known contents, like \"test number\\n1598293\".  They then watch all messages going through their remailer,\\nlooking for one whose contents match what they sent.  If they are the\\nlast remailer in the chain, when they see this message go through\\nthem, they can look at whom it is being sent to, and so they then know\\nyour true name.  So, a multi-remailer anonymous address is really no\\nmore secure than a single-remailer one.\\n\\nChaum, in his \"mix\" paper, avoided this problem by having the\\nanonymous addresses include a random number which each remailer sees\\nas it decrypts the incoming message.  (There is always such a number,\\nit turns out, for the RSA encryption to be secure.)  He had the mix,\\nas it passes the message through, encrypt the contents with a\\nsingle-key algorithm (like DES) using this random number as the key.\\nThis way the message is transformed at each step and so if it later\\ncomes back through the same mix, it won\\'t be recognizeable as the one\\nit sent earlier.  So the attack above fails.\\n\\nFor this to work, the user has to save the random numbers that were\\nused to construct his anonymous address, and decrypt the message using\\nDES with these as keys before going on to read it or public-key decrypt\\nit as usual.  This would be quite a bit less convenient.\\n\\nChaum goes on to say that these return addresses can only be used\\nonce.  I was a little puzzled by the exact attack that he is trying to\\ndefend against in applying this rule.  Chaum doesn\\'t always make the\\nattacks clear, leaving that as an exercise for the reader.  I believe\\nthe problem is that, say, the last remailer in the chain could send 100\\nmessages to a given anonymous address (all would have different\\ncontents).  Then, after working its way through the remailer chain, it\\nwould see 100 messages going to the same final destination.  It could\\nguess that those 100 were the 100 it sent, especially if it repeats this\\ntest every few days with different numbers.\\n\\nChaum\\'s rule of allowing each anonymous address to be used only once\\nmakes them much less useful.\\n\\nThese complications just go to show that real security doesn\\'t come\\neasy or cheap.  There is still work to be done before we achieve the\\ngoal of crypto anonymity.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: nobody@soda.berkeley.edu\\nDate: Sat, 5 Dec 92 19:21:20 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: remailers\\nMessage-ID: <9212060320.AA03303@soda.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nRemailers are proliferating!

Because of the possible legal repurcussions, I\\'d prefer\\nto remain anonymous at this time.  Thanks to the efforts of the people\\non this list, this is now possible.\\n\\nMy implementation is pretty far along.  It uses PGP modules for the\\narithmetic, so the speed is good.  It works on Unix and I should be\\nable to get it working on MSDOS in a day or two.  Sorry, I don\\'t have\\nthe ability to work on a Mac version.\\n\\nHere are some of the features.  The basic cash algorithm is the Chaum\\nsystem which was posted here.  Multiple denominations are supported,\\nusing different exponents for each denomination.  The program is\\npresented in the context of a package to be used for an email based\\ngame like Monopoly where the program would be used to allow cash\\ntransfers.  One player is the \"banker\", and he uses a different\\nexecution module than the other players.  The banker program keeps a\\ndatabase of used note numbers which is used to detect money reuse.\\nThe database is maintained using a freeware version of the \"dbm\"\\npackage, so it should be fast even for large note number databases.\\n\\nThe mapping between exponents and values is as follows:\\n\\n    exponent\\t    value\\n\\t17\\t\\t1\\n\\t19\\t\\t2\\n\\t23\\t\\t5\\n\\t29\\t\\t10\\n\\t31\\t\\t20\\n\\t37\\t\\t50\\n\\t41\\t\\t100\\n\\t43\\t\\t200\\n\\t47\\t\\t500\\n\\t53\\t\\t1000\\n\\t59\\t\\t2000\\n\\t61\\t\\t5000\\n\\t67\\t\\t10000\\n\\nand so on, up to a value of 2e9.  The exponents are ascending primes\\nstarting with 17.  This was chosen because you want them to be\\nsmallish for fast note checking, but it was too slow to find primes p\\nand q for the bank key such that (p-1)(q-1) was not divisible by any\\nsmall primes.  The program chooses random p and then tests p-1 to make\\nsure it passes the divisibility test, and rejects it if not.  Too many\\nwere being rejected when I started with an exponent of 3.  Starting\\nwith 17 rejects about 1/2 the exponents, compared to something like\\n80% when I started with 3.  The \"value\" fields are presumed to be\\ncents, but could be whatever you like.\\n\\nThe code I\\'ve written does not do anything other than the basic\\nelectronic cash algorithms.  It does not do bank account maintenance.\\nIt doesn\\'t do PGP encryption.  It doesn\\'t send mail.  (It does have\\nsome functions to scan and check the files created by the program.)\\n\\nCash generation is a 3 step process.  First, the user creates what I\\ncall a \"withdrawal request\" packet.  This is a set of triplets of the\\nform (e, s, refx), where e is the exponent from the table above, s is\\na 16-byte \"unique identifier\" used solely to link these withdrawal\\nrequests with the returned messages from the bank, and refx is r^e * f(x).\\nf(x) is MD5 of x, padded to the size of the bank\\'s modulus n using the\\nPGP routine which pads MD5 signatures.  This padding helps make sure the\\narithmetic is more \"mixing\".  x is the random input to MD5, which I\\'ve\\nchosen as 64 bytes since that is the block size MD5 works on.  (The\\noutput of MD5 is 16 bytes.)  r is the blinding factor.  This is now\\n128 bits long; longer r\\'s take too long to calculate r^-1 in the third\\nstep, below.  (It takes longer for PGP to calculate r^-1 than to do an\\nRSA decryption, for r = n = 1024 bits!)\\n\\nSecond, the bank program converts the withdrawal request packet into\\nwhat I call a \"withdrawal\" packet, by just RSA-decrypting the third\\nentry using the inverse exponent \"d\" for the value exponent \"e\".\\n(These \"d\" values are calculated at keygen time and stored with the\\nbank\\'s key information in a private file.)  I call the return triplet\\n(e, s, rfxd), where e is the value exponent again, s is the same\\nunique identifier, and rfxd is r * f(x)^d.\\n\\n(As I said above, the code I\\'ve written does not try to maintain\\naccount balances or do any other banking functions.  It just does the\\ncash algorithms.  There is a routine to scan a withdrawal request and\\nreturn the total value being requested for withdrawal.  The idea was\\nthat this could be used as input to a banking program to decide\\nwhether to allow the withdrawal.)\\n\\nThird, the \"player\" (e.g. user) program transforms the withdrawal\\npacket into a \"money\" packet, by un-blinding it.  To do this, it has\\nto recover the x and r which correspond with each triplet.  This is\\ndone by the use of a dbm database of \"pending withdrawal requests\"\\nwhich is written during step 1, above.  The database entries are keyed\\nby (e, s) and return the corresponding (x, r) which were generated\\nduring step 1.  Using x and r, the user transforms (e, s, rfxd) into\\n(e, x, fxd), the digital cash.  e is the value exponent, x is the\\nrandom 64-byte number, and fxd is f(x)^d, the signed version of the\\nMD5\\'d and padded x.\\n\\nThere are also player functions to scan and check a money file\\n(comparing a calculated f(x) to fxd^e), merge money files, and extract\\nsome items from a money file into another money file (this last is\\nwhat is to be used for payment).  There are banker functions to check\\nincoming money and compare against the used-note database, and to add\\nincoming money to that database.  (The database consists of the\\n16-byte f(x) values for each note.)\\n\\nI am pretty happy with the basic routines, but the user interface\\nneeds work.  There are three kinds of files floating around\\n(withdrawal requests, withdrawals, and money files) and I\\'m worried\\nthat this will be confusing to the user.  If he accidentally deletes\\none at the wrong time he could lose money permanently.  Or if he\\naccidentally reuses one he could be accused of fraud.  I\\'m not sure\\nwhat the best model is for the user.\\n\\nThe specific issues of creating withdrawal messages and extracting\\n\"bills\" from a money file are areas where the user interface should be\\nmade nice.  We want to make it easy for the user to specify exactly\\nwhat denominations he wants to work with.  One possibility is to\\nsimply have him input the amount (e.g. $10.55) and the program\\ncalculates that that\\'s a 1000, a 50, and a 5, but this isn\\'t really\\nflexible enough.  A nice system would be to give him a list of options\\nand let him fill out a form on-screen, but that\\'s hard to do portably.\\n\\nAnother idea I\\'ve had is that there should be a special money file\\ncalled the user\\'s \"wallet\" which is the default place where incoming\\nmoney from the bank should go.  This might help organize things.  He\\nstill needs to be able to create other money files for paying other\\npeople, and remembering to delete them after he sends them.\\n\\nAny suggestions or thoughts on these interface issues, or comments\\nabout how this program could or should be integrated into a larger\\nsystem, would be appreciated.\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nVersion: 2.0\\n\\nmQCNAisiUPkAAAED/i1Pf1DaubveDsgjh360rNJ7kWkhssobaVmmWa70l4lOTwy/\\nsGwhJaA+JdScO9g3B66DIAaU0GiNrTS4YEl/b5ohNDZFdqKlxZ7NW9A5JYjUlhGE\\na53cRwqUXs42kbPbMh/uKxXBgbUnKrKZnWAh29irDWb+G8OEPQrkCJ6S8691AAUR\\ntAl4UGhhZWRydXM=\\n=HVRq\\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: nobody@ocf.Berkeley.EDU\\nDate: Mon, 7 Dec 92 00:30:49 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: yet another remailer\\nMessage-ID: <199212070730.AA07386@plague.berkeley.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve set up another remailer, this one on my ocf account.

It doesn\\'t, but the code is a\\nlittle misleading (taken from mpilib.c, PGP 2.1):\\n\\n    while (bits--)\\n    {\\tmp_shift_left(prod);\\n\\tmsub(prod,pmodulus);\\t/* turns mult into modmult */\\n\\tif (sniff_bit(multiplier,bitmask))\\n\\t{   mp_add(prod,multiplicand);\\n\\t    msub(prod,pmodulus);\\t/* turns mult into modmult */\\n\\t}\\n\\tbump_bitsniffer(multiplier,bitmask);\\n    }\\n\\nWhat is confusing is that \"msub\" looks like \"mp_sub\".  Actually, msub\\nis a macro defined in mpilib.h:\\n\\n#define msub(r,m) if (mp_compare(r,m) >= 0) mp_sub(r,m)\\n\\t/* Prevents r from getting bigger than modulus m */\\n\\nSo, msub actually only subtracts if it\\'s necessary, as would be\\nexpected.\\n\\n\\nJim McGrath asks:\\n\\n> When PGP generates keys doesn\\'t it always pick d and e to have\\n> the same number of bits, ie 446 for the strongest type?\\n\\nd and e are the decryption and encryption exponents.  e is chosen to\\nbe small, typically the number 17 or slightly larger.  d is then about\\nthe size of n, your key modulus.\\n\\np and q, the two primes which are multiplied to get n, are about the\\nsame size, usually.  PGP does have some code to make sure they aren\\'t\\ntoo close to the same size (taken from rsagen.c, PGP 2.1):\\n\\n        /*\\tSee if p and q are far enough apart.  Is q-p big enough? */\\n        mp_move(u,q);\\t/* use u as scratchpad */\\n        mp_sub(u,p);\\t/* compute q-p */\\n        if (mp_tstminus(u))\\t/* p is bigger */\\n        {    mp_neg(u);\\n            too_close_together = (countbits(u) < (countbits(p)-7));\\n        }\\n        else\\t\\t/* q is bigger */\\n            too_close_together = (countbits(u) < (countbits(q)-7));\\n\\n        /* Keep trying q\\'s until we get one far enough from p... */\\n    } while (too_close_together);\\n\\nWhat this does is make sure that |p-q| is > 1/128 of the larger of p\\nor q.  This is designed to make sure that p and q are both very far\\nfrom the square root of n.  I.e. if n were 1024 bits, p and q could\\nboth be about 512 bits, but they would be at least about 2^505 from\\nthe square root of n, foiling the square root attacks.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: fnerd@smds.com (FutureNerd Steve Witham)\\nDate: Tue, 8 Dec 92 11:38:37 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: PGP questions\\nMessage-ID: <9212081910.AB28737@smds.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n>It\\'s probably good to discuss how PGP works here, for educational\\n>purposes, but I would expect people to get the source code if they\\n>really are interested.

By the way, sorry if my response\\ntime is long; I\\'ve been traveling for work lately.\\n\\nI suggested leaving the minimum set of compute-intensive routines\\nin C and implementing the higher-level stuff in some higher-level language \\n(\"HLL\"), possibly interpreted.  Hal pointed out some of the crunching \\njobs other than modmult.  Using an HLL has cons as well as pros to it.\\n\\nThe main advantage (for my purpose here) is that C code has a lot of noise \\nthat gets in the way of understanding.  This could also be improved by some \\ncoding style changes--for instance, using some object-oriented stuff (data \\nstructures that handle more of their own details) and, ahem, fewer #ifdefs...\\nAnother advantage of an HLL is ease of trying out different, er, schemes.\\n\\nIf I used an HLL, I think it would be one that had very C-like syntax.\\n\\nThe main drawback of an HLL is that it\\'s another program that you\\nhave to trust.  Sometimes inner parts of interpreters and compilers are \\nhard to write so that they are correct *and seem* correct when you look \\nat them.  A couple of things they can do are automatic space allocation, \\ngarbage collection and \"burning\" data that\\'s no longer in use (\"garbage \\nburning?\").\\n\\n-fnerd\\nquote me\\nfnerd@smds.com (FutureNerd Steve Witham)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Alan Hunter <a.hunter@dunaad.co.uk>\\nDate: Tue, 8 Dec 92 14:56:40 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re Anonymous address problems etc\\nMessage-ID: <2b25279b.dunaad@dunaad.co.uk>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn Mon, 7 Dec 92 16:59:12 PST, (Hal Finney) ghsvax!hal@uunet.uu.net wrote:\\n>\\n> On the digital cash issue - I think we should get some kind of\\n> implementation of digicash (oops, \"electronic money\") out for people\\n> on the list to play with.

This creates a difficult trade-off, for if traders spend\\n> too much time looking for a good deal, they may find themselves\\n> locked out of the market without trading anything.\\n>  \\n> HOW IS TRADER PERFORMANCE EVALUATED?\\n>  \\n> In the AZTE there is a well-defined performance measure: trading\\n> efficiency, EFF.  This is the ratio of profits a trader actually\\n> earns divided by the profits it would have made if all trades took\\n> place at the competitive equilibrium level.  Thus, if a trader\\'s\\n> EFF is greater than 100% they are earning more than their \"fair\"\\n> share of the profits.  The use of EFF is more desirable\\n> performance measure than simply using trading profits, since\\n> profits depend on the token allocations which are allocated at\\n> random from a known distribution.\\n>  \\n> After each trading session, participants will earn cash profits\\n> equal to the following linear function of their efficiency:\\n>  \\n>      $ payments =  a + b(EFF-100)\\n>  \\n> The term a represents a fixed fee paid for participating in the\\n> trading session and the term b(EFF-100) represents a bonus\\n> (penalty) for trading above (or below) 100% efficiency.  Thus, it\\n> is possible to lose money in any particular trading session.\\n> Dollar earnings are cumulated over successive trading sessions and\\n> subjects are eligible to \"cash out\" at any time after participating\\n> in a minimum number of trading sessions (provided cumulative\\n> earnings are positive).\\n>  \\n> THE OPPONENTS: COMPUTER PROGRAM TRADERS\\n>  \\n> Unlike real commodities markets where most traders are humans, in\\n> the AZTE all of your opponents will be computer programs.  The\\n> opponent programs will be selected from a field of over 30\\n> different trading strategies including winners of the Santa Fe\\n> Institute\\'s Double Auction Tournament held in March, 1990.  The\\n> program traders range in sophistication from simple rules of thumb\\n> (such as Gode-Sunder \"Zero-Intelligence\" strategy) to sophisticated\\n> optimizing/learning algorithms (such as neural nets and genetic\\n> algorithms) developed from the recent literature on artificial\\n> intelligence.

If you were\\nheading north on 101, you just come right off the exit to the\\nstoplight.  The light is the intersection of Amphitheatre and\\nCharleston Rd.  Take a right on Charleston; there\\'s a right-turn-only\\nlane.\\n\\nFollow Charleston for a short distance.  You\\'ll pass the\\nMetaphor/Kaleida buildings on the right.  At a clump of palm trees and\\na \"Landmark Deli\" sign, take a right into Landings Drive.  At the end\\nof the road, turn left into the complex with the big concrete\\n\"Landmark\" sign.

They\\'ll be\\nopen between noon and 1PM at least.  (See below if you\\'re late.)\\n\\nOnce inside, take the stairs up, immediately to your right.

I recommend hitting\\nthe burrito place on Rengstorff (La Costen~a) at about 11:45.  To get\\nthere, when you get off 101, take Rengstorff (toward the hills) rather\\nthan Amphitheatre (toward the bay).  Follow it about ten blocks until\\nthe major intersection at Middlefield Road.  La Costen~a is the store\\non your left at the corner.  You can turn left into the narrow lane\\nbehind the store, which leads to a parking lot, and enter by the front\\ndoor, which faces the intersection.

Probably I won\\'t\\nget it working until next weekend.\\n\\nTo recap, the program provides Chaum-style digital cash via two\\nexecutables, one for the \"players\" and one for the \"banker\".  The\\nbanker creates a public key which has a single modulus n and multiple\\nexponents, the prime numbers starting with 17.  He sends n to the\\nplayers and all is ready.\\n\\nPlayers withdraw money by running their programs and specifying the\\ndenominations they want to withdraw.  For example, you could withdraw\\na 1, two 5\\'s, a 10 and a 20.  This would create a file with 5 entries\\nto be sent to the bank.  PGP should be used to encrypt and\\nascii-encode this file (for privacy) and it should be mailed to the\\nbanker.\\n\\nThe banker receives this file and runs his program to RSA-sign the\\nvalues in each of the withdrawal-request entries.  This is the\\n\"blinded cash\" that Chaum describes.  Again, PGP should be used for\\nmailing this back to the user.\\n\\nThe player then has to \"unblind\" the file to make it \"real\" digital\\ncash.  This also changes it so that the bank won\\'t recognize it when\\nit is deposited.  He uses his version of the program to do this,\\nproducing an actual digital money file with the five \"digital bills\"\\nin it.\\n\\nTo pay another user, he runs another function to extract the desired\\nbills from this file.  Suppose he wants to extract a 1 and a 5.  This\\nleaves a 5, a 10 and a 20 in the original file, and creates a new\\ndigital cash file with a 1 and a 5.  He would then use PGP again to\\nencrypt this for safety and mail it to the person he wants to pay.\\n\\nThat person can run a \"check\" function on the incoming digital money\\nto make sure it has a proper bank signature on it and is not a\\nforgery.  He would then mail it directly to the bank so that it could\\nget credited to his account.\\n\\nThe banker runs his program which checks the signatures on the\\nincoming money, looks in a database file to make sure these bills\\nhaven\\'t been used before, and adds these bills to the database.  (The\\ndatabase stores 16 bytes per bill.)  He should then record the deposit\\nand perhaps send a confirmation to the depositor (my program doesn\\'t\\nget involved with that).\\n\\nI hope this gives a clearer picture of how the electronic money\\nprogram works.  It is a simple implementation but I think many systems\\nwould work similarly.\\n\\nI appreciated the suggestion to use cash as part of the list\\nmanagement itself.  Rather than paying people who post, I wonder if it\\nwould be better to make people pay to post.  Many people have\\ncomplained about the volume.  :)  Unfortunately, I suspect that this\\nwould involve too much overhead for the mailing list maintainer.\\n\\nMaybe the thing to do is to just get the software out there and let\\npeople decide what they want to do with it (if anything).  I\\'m\\nprobably going to take a couple more weeks to clean up the user\\ninterface and get these bugs out, then I\\'ll try sending it someone to\\nbe put on the cypherpunks ftp archive.\\n\\nIt\\'s nice to be able to finally sign these messages!\\n\\n- -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\nmQCNAisiUPkAAAED/i1Pf1DaubveDsgjh360rNJ7kWkhssobaVmmWa70l4lOTwy/\\nsGwhJaA+JdScO9g3B66DIAaU0GiNrTS4YEl/b5ohNDZFdqKlxZ7NW9A5JYjUlhGE\\na53cRwqUXs42kbPbMh/uKxXBgbUnKrKZnWAh29irDWb+G8OEPQrkCJ6S8691AAUR\\ntAl4UGhhZWRydXM=\\n=HVRq\\n- -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\niQCVAgUBKyZADQrkCJ6S8691AQHneQP8DRdkOFfG9TwjGDJAX4IxymvzAITqYIJC\\naMhytyzqFwP6Dku955ZHEPL1SDpNCU8DwK7eKDOgvHRS3m+kihs1l6VR3Gf0AgGw\\n7jjRJlt7hcqfT16fLHVXtn27A16rUhl2hKrD702wjGzX+MN7mS/8MW2kchVfvQYX\\nM/McOuwuIjs=\\n=/HGX\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: mark@coombs.anu.edu.au (Mark)\\nDate: Thu, 10 Dec 92 17:24:57 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: Questions about US/Canadian Laws about public encryption\\nIn-Reply-To: <BysM6J.76z@minerva1.bull.it>\\nMessage-ID: <mark.724036564@coombs>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nDavid Banisar <Banisar@washofc.cpsr.org> quotes:\\n\\n>> (1) Is feeding public data or telephone networks with crypted data\\n>>     illegal or those who posted articles on the subject were just\\n>>     wishing it were made illegal ???\\n\\nOne might ask that they prove it is encrypted and not merely garbage your\\npumping down the line to defeat traffic analysis attacks.

Untraceability, Unconditional Security, Pseudonymity.\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nThree cryptographers are sitting down to dinner at their favorite \\nthree-star restaurant. Their waiter informs them that arrangements \\nhave been made with the maitre d\\'hotel for the bill to be paid \\nanonymously. One of the cryptographers might be paying for the dinner, \\nor it might have been NSA (U.S. National Security Agency). The three \\ncryptographers respect each other\\'s right to make an anonymous \\npayment, but they wonder if NSA is paying. They resolve their \\nuncertainty fairly by carrying out the following protocol:\\n\\nEach cryptographer flips an unbiased coin behind his menu, between \\nhim and the cryptographer on his right, so that only the two of them can \\nsee the outcome. Each cryptographer then states aloud whether the two \\ncoins he can see--the one he flipped and the one his left-hand neighbor \\nflipped--fell on the same side or on different sides. If one of the \\ncryptographers is the payer, he states the opposite of what he sees. An \\nodd number of differences uttered at the table indicates that a \\ncryptographer is paying; an even number indicates that NSA is paying \\n(assuming that the dinner was paid for only once). Yet if a \\ncryptographer is paying, neither of the other two learns anything from \\nthe utterances about which cryptographer it is.\\n\\nTo see why the protocol is unconditionally secure if carried out \\nfaithfully, consider the dilemma of a cryptographer who is not the \\npayer and wishes to find out which cryptographer is. (If NSA pays, there \\nis no anonymity problem.) There are two cases. In case (1) the two \\ncoins he sees are the same, one of the other cryptographers said \\n\"different,\" and the other one said \"same.\" If the hidden outcome was \\nthe same as the two outcomes he sees, the cryptographer who said \\n\"different\" is the payer; if the outcome was different, the one who said \\n\"same\" is the payer. But since the hidden coin is fair, both possibilities \\nare equally likely. In case (2) the coins he sees are different; if both \\nother cryptographers said \"different,\" then the payer is closest to the \\ncoin that is the same as the hidden coin; if both said \"same,\" then the \\npayer is closest to the coin that differs from the hidden coin. Thus, in \\neach subcase, a nonpaying cryptographer learns nothing about which of \\nthe other two is paying.\\n\\nThe cryptographers become intrigued with the ability to make \\nmessages public untraceably. They devise a way to do this at the table \\nfor a statement of arbitrary length: the basic protocol is repeated over \\nand over; when one cryptographer wishes to make a message public, he \\nmerely begins inverting his statements in those rounds corresponding \\nto 1 \\'s in a binary coded version of his message. If he notices that his \\nmessage would collide with some other message, he may for example \\nwait a number of rounds chosen at random from a suitable distribution \\nbefore trying to transmit again.\\n\\n1. Generalizing the Approach\\n\\nDuring dinner, the cryptographers also consider how any number of \\nparticipants greater than one can carry out a version of the protocol. \\n(With two participants, only nonparticipant listeners are unable to \\ndistinguish between the two potential senders.) Each participant has a \\nsecret key bit in common with, say, every other participant. Each \\nparticipant outputs the sum, modulo two, of all the key bits he shares, \\nand if he wishes to transmit, he inverts his output. If no participant \\ntransmits, the modulo two sum of the outputs must be zero, since every \\nkey bit enters exactly twice; if one participant transmits, the sum \\nmust be one. (In fact, any even number of transmitting participants \\nyields zero, and any odd number yields one.) For j rounds, each \\nparticipant could have a j-bit key in common with every other \\nparticipant, and the ith bit of each such key would be used only in the \\nith round. Detected collision of messages leads to attempted \\nretransmission as described above; undetected collision results only \\nfrom an odd number of synchronized identical message segments. \\n(Generalization to fields other than GF(2) is possible, but seems to \\noffer little practical advantage.)\\n\\nOther generalizations are also considered during dinner. The \\nunderlying assumptions are first made explicit, including modeling \\nkey-sharing arrangements as graphs. Next, the model is illustrated \\nwith some simple examples. The potential for cooperations of \\nparticipants to violate the security of others is then looked at. Finally, \\na proof of security based on systems of linear equations is given.\\n\\n1.1. Model\\n\\nEach participant is assumed to have two kinds of secret: (a) the keys \\nshared with other participants for each round; and (b) the inversion \\nused in each round (i.e., a 1 if the participant inverts in that round and a \\n0 if not). Some or all of a participant\\'s secrets may be given to other \\nparticipants in various forms of collusion, discussion of which is \\npostponed until Section 1.3. (For simplicity in exposition, the \\npossibility of secrets being stolen is ignored throughout.)\\n\\nThe remaining information about the system may be described as: (a)\\nwho shares keys with whom; and (b) what each participant outputs\\nduring each round (the modulo two sum of that participant\\'s keys and\\ninversion). This information need not be secret to ensure\\nuntraceability. If it is publicly known and agreed, it allows various\\nextensions discussed in Sections 2.5 and 2.6. The sum of all the\\noutputs will, of course, usually become known to all participants.\\n\\nIn the terminology of graphs, each participant corresponds to a \\nvertex and each key corresponds to an edge. An edge is incident on the \\nvertices corresponding to the pair of participants that shares the \\ncorresponding key. From here on, the graph and dinner-table \\nterminologies will be used interchangeably. Also, without loss of \\ngenerality, it will be assumed that the graph is connected (i.e., that a \\npath exists between every pair of vertices), since each connected \\ncomponent (i.e., each maximal connected subgraph) could be considered \\na separate untraceable-sender system.\\n\\nAn anonymity set seen by a set of keys is the set of vertices in a \\nconnected component of the graph formed from the original graph by \\nremoving the edges concerned. Thus a set of keys sees one anonymity \\nset for each connected partition induced by removing the keys. The main \\ntheorem of Section 1.4 is essentially that those having only the public \\ninformation and a set of keys seeing some anonymity set can learn \\nnothing about the members of that anonymity set except the overall \\nparity of their inversions. Thus, for example, any two participants \\nconnected by at least one chain of keys unknown to an observer are both \\nin the same anonymity set seen by the observer\\'s keys, and the observer \\ngains nothing that would help distinguish between their messages.\\n\\n1.2. Some Examples\\n\\nA few simple consequences of the above model may be illustrative. The \\nanonymity set seen by the empty set (i.e., by a nonparticipant observer) \\nis the set of all vertices, since the graph is assumed connected and \\nremains so after zero edges are removed. Also, the anonymity sets seen \\nby the full set of edges are all singleton sets, since each vertex\\'s \\ninversion is just the sum of its output and the corresponding key bits.\\n\\nIf all other participants cooperate fully against one, of course no \\nprotocol can keep that singleton\\'s messages untraceable, since \\nuntraceability exists only among a set of possible actors, and if the set \\nhas only one member, its messages are traceable. For similar reasons, \\nif a participant believes that some subset of other participants will \\nfully cooperate against him, there is no need for him to have keys in \\ncommon with them.\\n\\nA biconnected graph (i.e., a graph with at least two vertex-disjoint \\npaths between every pair of vertices) has no cut-vertices (i.e., a single \\nvertex whose removal partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs). In \\nsuch a graph, the set of edges incident on a vertex v sees (apart from v) \\none anonymity set containing all other vertices, since there is a path \\nnot containing v between every pair of vertices, and thus they form a \\nconnected subgraph excluding v; each participant acting alone learns \\nnothing about the contribution of other participants.\\n\\n1.3. Collusion of Participants\\n\\nSome participants may cooperate by pooling their keys in efforts to \\ntrace the messages of others; such cooperation will be called collusion. \\nFor simplicity, the possibilities for multiple collusions or for pooling \\nof information other than full edges will be ignored. Colluders who lie \\nto each other are only touched on briefly, in Section 2.6.\\n\\nConsider collusion in a complete graph. A vertex is only seen as a \\nsingleton anonymity set by the collection of all edges incident on it; all \\nother participants must supply the key they share with a participant in \\norder to determine that participant\\'s inversions. But since a collusion \\nof all but one participant can always trace that participant merely by \\npooling its members\\' inversions as already mentioned, it gains nothing \\nmore by pooling its keys. The nonsingleton anonymity set seen by all \\nedges incident on a colluding set of vertices in a complete graph is the \\nset of all other vertices; again, a collusion yields nothing more from \\npooling all its keys than from pooling all its inversions.\\n\\nNow consider noncomplete graphs. A full collusion is a subset of \\nparticipants pooling all of their keys. The pooled keys see each colluder \\nas a singleton anonymity set; the colluders completely sacrifice the \\nuntraceability of their own messages. If a full collusion includes a cut-\\nset of vertices (i.e., one whose removal partitions the graph), the \\ncollusion becomes nontrivial because it can learn something about the \\norigin of messages originating outside the collusion; the noncolluding \\nvertices are partitioned into disjoint subgraphs, which are the \\nanonymity sets seen by the pooled keys.\\n\\nMembers of a partial collusion pool some but not all of their keys. \\nUnlike the members of a full collusion, each member of a partial \\ncollusion in general has a different set of keys. For it to be nontrivial, \\na partial collusion\\'s pooled keys must include the bridges or separating \\nedges of a segregation or splitting of the graph (i.e., those edges whose \\nremoval would partition the graph). Settings are easily constructed in \\nwhich the pooled keys see anonymity sets that partition the graph and \\nyet leave each colluder in a nonsingleton partition seen by any other \\nparticipant. Thus, colluders can join a collusion without having to make \\nthemselves completely traceable to the collusion\\'s other members.\\n\\n1.4. Proof of Security\\n\\nConsider, without loss of generality, a single round in which say some \\nfull collusion knows some set of keys. Remove the edges known to the \\ncollusion from the key-sharing graph and consider any particular \\nconnected component C of the remaining graph. The vertices of C thus \\nform an anonymity set seen by the pooled keys.\\n\\nInformally, what remains to be shown is that the only thing the \\ncollusion learns about the members of C is the parity sum of their \\ninversions. This is intuitively apparent, since the inversions of the \\nmembers of C are each in effect hidden from the collusion by one or \\nmore unknown key bits, and only the parity of the sum of these key bits \\nis known (to be zero). Thus the inversions are hidden by a one-time pad, \\nand only their parity is revealed, because only the parity of the pad is \\nknown.\\n\\nThe setting is formalized as follows: the connected component C is \\ncomprised of rn vertices and n edges. The incidence matrix M of C is \\ndefined as usual, with the vertices labeling the rows and the edges \\nlabeling the columns. Let K, I, and A be stochastic variables defined on \\nGF(2)^n, GF(2)^m, and GF(2)^m, respectively, such that\\nK is uniformly distributed over GF(2)^n, K and I are mutually \\nindependent, and A = (MK) cross I. In terms of the protocol, K comprises \\nthe keys corresponding to the edges, I consists of the inversions \\ncorresponding to the vertices, and A is formed by the outputs of the \\nvertices. Notice that the parity of A (i.e., the modulo two sum of its \\ncomponents) is always equal to the parity of I, since the columns of M \\neach have zero parity. The desired result is essentially that A reveals \\nno more information about I than the parity of 1. More formally:\\n\\nTheorem.  Let a be in GF(2)^n. For each i in GF(2)^n, which is assumed by \\nI with nonzero probability and which has the same parity as a, the \\nconditional probability that A = a given that I = i is 2^(1 - m). Hence, \\nthe conditional probability that I = i given that A = a is the a priori \\nprobability that I = i.\\n\\nProof.  Let i be an element of GF(2)^n have the same parity as a. \\nConsider the system of linear equations (MK) cross i = a, in k an \\nelement of GF(2)^n. Since the columns of M each have even parity, as \\nmentioned above, its rows are linearly dependent over GF(2)^m. But as a \\nconsequence of the connectedness of the graph, every proper subset of \\nrows of M is linearly independent. Thus, the rank of M is m - 1, and so \\neach vector with zero parity can be written as a linear combination of \\nthe columns of M. This implies that the system is solvable because i \\ncross a has even parity. Since the set of n column vectors of M has rank \\nm - 1, the system has exactly 2^(n - m + 1) solutions.\\n\\nTogether with the fact that K and I are mutually independent and \\nthat K is uniformly distributed, the theorem follows easily.                           \\n\\n2. Some Practical Considerations\\n\\nAfter dinner, while discussing how they can continue to make \\nuntraceable statements from this respective homes, the cryptographers \\ntake up a variety of other topics. In particular, they consider different \\nways to establish the needed keys; debate adapting the approach to \\nvarious kinds of communication networks; examine the traditional \\nproblems of secrecy and authentication in the context of a system that \\ncan provide essentially optimal untraceability; address denial of \\nservice caused by malicious and devious participants; and propose \\nmeans to discourage socially undesirable messages from being sent.\\n\\n2.1. Establishing Keys\\n\\nOne way to provide the keys needed for longer messages is for one \\nmember of each pair to toss many coins in advance. Two identical \\ncopies of the resulting bits are made, say each on a separate optical \\ndisk. Supplying one such disk (which today can hold on the order of \\n10^10 bits) to a partner provides enough key bits to allow people to \\ntype messages at full speed for years. If participants are not \\ntransmitting all the time, the keys can be made to last even longer by \\nusing a substantially slower rate when no message is being sent; the \\nfull rate would be invoked automatically only when a 1 bit indicated \\nthe beginning of a message. (This can also reduce the bandwidth \\nrequirements discussed in Section 2.2.)\\n\\nAnother possibility is for a pair to establish a short key and use a \\ncryptographic pseudorandom-sequence generator to expand it as needed. \\nOf course this system might be broken if the generator were broken. \\nCryptanalysis may be made more difficult, however, by lack of access \\nto the output of individual generators. Even when the cryptographers do \\nnot exchange keys at dinner, they can safely do so later using a public-\\nkey distribution system (first proposed by [4] and [3]).\\n\\n2.2 Underlying Communication Techniques\\n\\nA variety of underlying communication networks can be used, and their \\ntopology need not be related to that of the key-sharing graph.\\n\\nCommunication systems based on simple cycles, called rings, are \\ncommon in local area networks. In a typical ring, each node receives \\neach bit and passes it round-robin to the next node. This technology is \\nreadily adapted to the present protocols. Consider a single-bit message \\nlike the \"I paid\" message originally sent at the dinner table. Each \\nparticipant exclusive-or\\'s the bit he receives with his own output \\nbefore forwarding it to the next participant. When the bit has traveled \\nfull circle, it is the exclusive-or sum of all the participants\\' outputs, \\nwhich is the desired result of the protocol. To provide these messages \\nto all participants, each bit is sent around a second time by the \\nparticipant at the end of the loop.\\n\\nSuch an adapted ring requires, on average, a fourfold increase in \\nbandwidth over the obvious traceable protocols in which messages \\ntravel only halfway around on average before being taken off the ring by \\ntheir recipients. Rings differ from the dinner table in that several bit-\\ntransmission delays may be required before all the outputs of a \\nparticular round are known to all participants; collisions are detected \\nonly after such delays.\\n\\nEfficient use of many other practical communication techniques \\nrequires participants to group output bits into blocks. For example, in \\nhigh-capacity broadcast systems, such as those based on coaxial cable, \\nsurface radio, or satellites, more efficient use of channel capacity is \\nobtained by grouping a participant\\'s contribution into a block about the \\nsize of a single message (see, e.g., [5]). Use of such communication \\ntechniques could require an increase in bandwidth on the order of the \\nnumber of participants.\\n\\nIn a network with one message per block, the well-known contention \\nprotocols can be used: time is divided evenly into frames; a participant \\ntransmits a block during one frame; if the block was garbled by \\ncollision (presumably with another transmitted block), the participant \\nwaits a number of frames chosen at random from some distribution \\nbefore attempting to retransmit; the participants\\' waiting intervals \\nmay be adjusted on the basis of the collision rate and possibly of other \\nheuristics [5].\\n\\nIn a network with many messages per block, a first block may be \\nused by various anonymous senders to request a \"slot reservation\" in a \\nsecond block. A simple scheme would be for each anonymous sender to \\ninvert one randomly selected bit in the first block for each slot they \\nwish to reserve in the second block. After the result of the first block \\nbecomes known, the participant who caused the ith 1 bit in the first \\nblock sends in the ith slot of the second block.\\n\\n2.3. Example Key-Sharing Graphs\\n\\nIn large systems it may be desirable to use fewer than the m(m - 1)/2 \\nkeys required by a complete graph. If the graph is merely a cycle, then \\nindividuals acting alone learn nothing, but any two colluders can \\npartition the graph, perhaps fully compromising a participant \\nimmediately between them. Such a topology might nevertheless be \\nadequate in an application in which nearby participants are not likely \\nto collude against one another.\\n\\nA different topology assumes the existence of a subset of \\nparticipants who each participant believes are sufficiently unlikely to \\ncollude, such as participants with conflicting interests. This subset \\nconstitutes a fully connected subgraph, and the other participants each \\nshare a key with every member of it. Every participant is then \\nuntraceable among all the others, unless all members of the completely \\nconnected subset cooperate. (Such a situation is mentioned again in \\nSection 3.)\\n\\nIf many people wish to participate in an untraceable communication \\nsystem, hierarchical arrangements may offer further economy of keys. \\nConsider an example in which a representative from each local fully \\nconnected subgraph is also a member of the fully connected central \\nsubgraph. The nonrepresentative members of a local subgraph provide \\nthe sum of their outputs to their representative. Representatives would \\nthen add their own contributions before providing the sum to the \\ncentral subgraph. Only a local subgraph\\'s representative, or a collusion \\nof representatives from all other local subgraphs, can recognize \\nmessages as coming from the local subgraph. A collusion comprising \\nthe representative and all but one nonrepresentative member of a local \\nsubgraph is needed for messages to be recognized as coming from the \\nremaining member.\\n\\n2.4. Secrecy and Authentication\\n\\nWhat about the usual cryptologic problems of secrecy and \\nauthentication?\\n\\nA cryptographer can ensure the secrecy of an anonymous message by \\nencrypting the message with the intended recipient\\'s public key. (The \\nmessage should include a hundred or so random bits to foil attempts to \\nconfirm a guess at its content [1].) The sender can even keep the \\nidentity of the intended recipient secret by leaving it to each recipient \\nto try to decrypt every message. Alternatively, a prearranged prefix \\ncould be attached to each message so that the recipient need only \\ndecrypt messages with recognized prefixes. To keep even the \\nmultiplicity of a prefix\\'s use from being revealed, a different prefix \\nmight be used each time. New prefixes could be agreed in advance, \\ngenerated cryptographically as needed, or supplied in earlier messages.\\n\\nAuthentication is also quite useful in systems without identification.\\nEven though the messages are untraceable, they might still bear\\ndigital signatures corresponding to public-key \"digital pseudonyms\"\\n[1]; only the untraceable owner of such a pseudonym would be able to\\nsign subsequent messages with it. Secure payment protocols have\\nelsewhere been proposed in which the payer and/or the payee might be\\nuntraceable [2]. Other protocols have been proposed that allow\\nindividuals known only by pseudonyms to transfer securely information\\nabout themselves between organizations [2]. All these systems require\\nsolutions to the sender untraceability problem, such as the solution\\npresented here, if they are to protect the unlinkability of pseudonyms\\nused to conduct transactions from home.\\n\\n2.5. Disruption\\n\\nAnother question is how to stop participants who, accidentally or even \\nintentionally, disrupt the system by preventing others from sending \\nmessages. In a sense, this problem has no solution, since any \\nparticipant can send messages continuously, thereby clogging the \\nchannel. But nondisupters can ultimately stop disruption in a system \\nmeeting the following requirements: (1) the key-sharing graph is \\npublicly agreed on; (2) each participant\\'s outputs are publicly agreed on \\nin such a way that participants cannot change their output for a round \\non the basis of other participants\\' outputs for that round; and (3) some \\nrounds contain inversions that would not compromise the \\nuntraceability of any nondisrupter.\\n\\nThe first requirement has already been mentioned in Section 1.1, \\nwhere it was said that this information need not be secret; now it is \\nrequired that this information actually be made known to all \\nparticipants and that the participants agree on it.\\n\\nThe second requirement is in part that disrupters be unable (at least \\nwith some significant probability) to change their output after hearing \\nother participants\\' outputs. Some actual channels would automatically \\nensure this, such as broadcast systems in which all broadcasts are \\nmade simultaneously on different frequencies. The remainder of the \\nsecond requirement, that the outputs be publicly agreed on, might also \\nbe met by broadcasting. Having only channels that do not provide it \\nautomatically, an effective way to meet the full second requirement \\nwould be for participants to \"commit\" to their outputs before making \\nthem. One way to do this is for participants to make public and agree on \\nsome (possibly compressing and hierarchical, see Section 2.6) one-way \\nfunction of their outputs, before the outputs are made public.\\n\\nThe third requirement is that at least some rounds can be contested \\n(i.e., that all inversions can be made public) without compromising the \\nuntraceability of non-disrupting senders. The feasibility of this will be \\ndemonstrated here by a simple example protocol based on the slot \\nreservation technique already described in Section 2.2.\\n\\nSuppose that each participant is always to make a single reservation \\nin each reserving block, whether or not he actually intends to send a \\nmessage. (Notice that, because of the \"birthday paradox,\" the number of \\nbits per reserving block must be quadratic in the number of \\nparticipants.) A disrupted reserving block would then with very high \\nprobability have Hamming weight unequal to the number of participants. \\nAll bits of such a disrupted reserving block could be contested without \\nloss of untraceability for nondisrupters.\\n\\nThe reserved blocks can also be made to have such safely contestable\\nbits if participants send trap messages. To lay a trap, a participant\\nfirst chooses the index of a bit in some reserving block, a random\\nmessage, and a secret key. Then the trapper makes public an\\nencryption, using the secret key, of both the bit index and the random\\nmessage. Later, the trapper reserves by inverting in the round\\ncorresponding to the bit index, and sends the random message in the\\nresulting reserved slot. If a disrupter is unlucky enough to have\\ndamaged a trap message, then release of the secret key by the trapper\\nwould cause at least one bit of the reserved slot to be contested.\\n\\nWith the three requirements satisfied, it remains to be shown how \\nif enough disrupted rounds are contested, the disrupters will be \\nexcluded from the network.\\n\\nConsider first the case of a single participant\\'s mail computer \\ndisrupting the network. If it tells the truth about contested key bits it \\nshares (or lies about an even number of bits), the disrupter implicates \\nitself, because its contribution to the sum is unequal to the sum of \\nthese bits (apart from any allowed inversion). If, on the other hand, the \\nsingle disrupter lies about some odd number of shared bits, the values \\nit claims will differ from those claimed for the same shared bits by \\nthe other participants sharing them. The disrupter thereby casts \\nsuspicion on all participants, including itself, that share the disputed \\nbits. (It may be difficult for a disrupter to cast substantial suspicion \\non a large set of participants, since all the disputed bits will be in \\ncommon with the disrupter.) Notice, however, that participants who \\nhave been falsely accused will know that they have been--and by \\nwhom--and should at least refuse to share bits with the disrupter in \\nthe future.\\n\\nEven with colluding multiple disrupters, at least one inversion must \\nbe revealed as illegitimate or at least one key bit disputed, since the \\nparity of the outputs does not correspond to the number of legitimate \\ninversions. The result of such a contested round will be the removal of \\nat least one edge or at least one vertex from the agreed graph. Thus, if \\nevery disruptive action has a nonzero probability of being contested, \\nonly a bounded amount of disruption is possible before the disrupters \\nshare no keys with anyone in the network, or before they are revealed, \\nand are in either case excluded from the network.\\n\\nThe extension presented next can demonstrate the true value of \\ndisputed bits, and hence allows direct incrimination of disrupters.\\n\\n2.6. Tracing by Consent\\n\\nAntisocial use of a network can be deterred if the cooperation of most \\nparticipants makes it possible, albeit expensive, to trace any message. \\nIf, for example, a threatening message is sent, a court might order all \\nparticipants to reveal their shared key bits for a round of the message. \\nThe sender of the offending message might try to spread the blame, \\nhowever, by lying about some odd number of shared bits. Digital \\nsignatures can be used to stop such blame-spreading altogether. In \\nprinciple, each party sharing a key could insist on a signature, made by \\nthe other party sharing, for the value. of each shared bit.\\n\\nSuch signatures would allow for contested rounds to be fully resolved,\\nfor accused senders to exonerate themselves, and even for colluders to\\nconvince each other that they are pooling true keys.  Unfortunately,\\ncooperating participants able to trace a message to its sender could\\nconvince others of the message\\'s origin by revealing the sender\\'s own\\nsignatures. A variation can prevent a participant\\'s signatures from\\nbeing used against him in this way: instead of each member of a pair\\nof participants signing the same shared key bit, each signs a separate\\nbit, such that the sum of the signed bits is the actual shared key\\nbit. Signatures on such \"split\" key bits would still be useful in\\nresolving contested rounds, since if one contester of a bit shows a\\nsignature made by the second contester, then the second would have to\\nreveal the corresponding signature made by the first or be thought to\\nbe a disrupter.\\n\\nIn many applications it may be impractical to obtain a separate \\nsignature on every key bit or split key bit. The overhead involved could \\nbe greatly reduced, however, by digitally signing cryptographic \\ncompressions of large numbers of key bits. This might of course require \\nthat a whole block of key bits be exposed in showing a signature, but \\nsuch blocks could be padded with cryptographically generated \\npseudorandom (or truly random) bits, to allow the exposure of fewer \\nbits per signature. The number of bits and amount of time required to \\nverify a signature for a single bit can be reduced further by using a \\nrooted tree in which each node is the one-way compression function of \\nall its direct descendants; only a digital signature of each participant\\'s \\nroot need be agreed on before use of the keys comprising the leaves.\\n\\n3. Relation to Previous Work\\n\\nThere is another multiparty-secure sender-untraceability protocol in \\nthe literature [1]. To facilitate comparison, it will be called a mix-net \\nhere, while the protocol of the present work is called a dc-net. The \\nmix-net approach relies on the security of a true public-key system \\n(and possibly also of a conventional cryptosystem), and is thus at best \\ncomputationally secure; the dc-net approach can use unconditional \\nsecrecy channels to provide an unconditionally secure untraceable-\\nsender system, or can use public-key distribution to provide a \\ncomputationally secure system (as described in Section 2.1).\\n\\nUnder some trust assumptions and channel limitations, however, \\nmix-nets can operate where dc-nets cannot. Suppose that a subset of \\nparticipants is trusted by every other participant not to collude and \\nthat the bandwidth of at least some participants\\' channels to the \\ntrusted subset is incapable of handling the total message traffic. Then \\nmix-nets may operate quite satisfactorily, but dc-nets will be unable \\nto protect fully each participant\\'s untraceability. Mix-nets can also \\nprovide recipient untraceability in this communication environment, \\neven though there is insufficient bandwidth for use of the broadcast \\napproach (mentioned in Section 2.4).\\n\\nIf optimal protection against collusion is to be provided and the \\ncrypto-security of mix-nets is acceptable, a choice between mix-nets \\nand dc-nets may depend on the nature of the traffic. With a mail-like \\nsystem that requires only periodic deliveries, and where the average \\nnumber of messages per interval is relatively large, mix-nets may be \\nsuitable. When messages must be delivered continually and there is no \\ntime for batching large numbers of them, dc-nets appear preferable.\\n\\n4. Conclusion\\n\\nThis solution to the dining cryptographers problem demonstrates that\\nunconditional secrecy channels can be used to construct an\\nunconditional sender-untraceability channel. It also shows that a\\npublic-key distribution system can be used to construct a\\ncomputationally secure sender-untraceability channel. The approach\\nappears able to satisfy a wide range of practical concerns.\\n\\nAcknowledgments\\n\\nI am pleased to thank Jurjen Bos, Gilles Brassard, Jan-Hendrik Evertse, \\nand the untraceable referees for all their help in revising this article. \\nIt is also a pleasure to thank, as in the original version that was \\ndistributed at Crypto 84, Whitfield Diffie, Ron Rivest, and Gus Simmons \\nfor some stimulating dinner-table conversations.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[1]\\tChaum, D., Untraceable Electronic Mail, Return Addresses, and \\nDigital Pseudonyms, Communications of the  ACM, vol. 24, no. 2, \\nFebruary 1981, pp. 84-88.\\n[2]\\tChaum, D., Security Without Identification: Transaction Systems \\nto Make Big Brother Obsolete, Communications of the ACM, vol. 28, \\nno. 10, October 1985, pp. 1030-1044.\\n[3]\\tDiffie, W., and Hellman, M.E., New Directions in Cryptography, IEEE \\nTransactions on Information Theory, vol. 22, no. 6, November 1976, \\npp. 644-654.\\n[4]\\tMerkle, R.C., Secure Communication over Insecure Channels, \\nCommunications of the ACM, vol. 21, no. 4, 1978, pp. 294-299.\\n[5]\\tTanenbaum, A.S., Computer Networks, Prentice Hall, Englewood \\nCliffs, New Jersey, 1981.\\n\\n\\n[End of Transmission]\\n\\n\\n\\n-- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eli Brandt <ebrandt@jarthur.Claremont.EDU>\\nDate: Fri, 11 Dec 92 15:39:32 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: YA remailer\\nMessage-ID: <9212112339.AA11270@toad.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nI have a Hal-standard remailer running at this address,\\nebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu -- haven\\'t compiled PGP\\non this silly Sequent box yet, so no ARA\\'s.\\n\\n\\t PGP 2 key by finger or e-mail    (and finger works now)\\n   Eli   ebrandt@jarthur.claremont.edu\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Bill O\\'Hanlon <wmo@rebma.rebma.mn.org>\\nDate: Fri, 11 Dec 92 18:27:14 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: keys for me and remailer@rebma.mn.org\\nMessage-ID: <m0n0MGM-0006XZC@rebma.rebma.mn.org>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know how much use this is, since no one has signed my key, but here\\nit is, plus the key for the remailer here at rebma, signed by me.\\n\\nIf anyone is going to be in the Minneapolis area, lemme know.\\n\\nHere\\'s mine:\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\nmQCNAirR6jkAAAEEAOMZFXG8bGGSpctmszxLug8IoLi55pUy+gR81K6ZBfLOmrTh\\nXCeuSBZ+yi6IZXuabOTsKo9r6wHVAvumZlfMvcp9Jbasp6Lc756aacsatHYsiQR4\\n7feUmp/coOyZ4ZfAXCmapc3dozYB9vWoWMhQy8QmWhotR8zTLRlm7A4meZALAAUR\\ntCBXYXJyaW9yIDx3bW9AcmVibWEubW4ub3JnPiBrZXkgMg==\\n=3/XA\\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nAnd here\\'s the remailers:\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\nmQCNAisUI2QAAAEEAKgm07Hsje5KpmXYd5azk0R6AES+qK7LcofnVGojUs7GBghD\\nWbwrmW8oOEOhRorlShRALKeYspV4xYIw4WDkJcJxuf1B254scz1urF/Eem3zPW9b\\nyPAx7W/cGwvs6SouZvFcSDq4v1zApvGE9hP4szPzHeGmVr0NVNeaDK0guoCpAAUR\\ntCBSZW1haWxlciAocmVtYWlsZXJAcmVibWEubW4ub3JnKYkAlQIFECsUJGEYkFR3\\njlSfhwEB1zgD/1LG9DttNEVPFddxkULPw+AkkbmSolrqJUmVx/3y3QS1AtW+vVqF\\n0yhgWgvg770b7+xMnwzO/I1nh0FK2shd1Jkx4FVCA5ctyqUzVFjk1NE6VaaRc5Bv\\nBD1nUxtUheR0WXDc50f+ANHgRNkx22MGRvphseMyXq/Ok88opSn7DIrO\\n=nBQt\\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\n-- \\nBill O\\'Hanlon\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t wmo@rebma.mn.org\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tcmay@netcom.com (Timothy C.

At the time of the request, it\\nwas not definitely known whether the parts requested by\\nGilmore had been re-classified.    \\n\\nUnder the FOIA, agencies are required to communicate\\nresponses to requesters within statutorily prescribed time\\nperiods.  Failure to comply with the time limits for response\\nconstitutes a denial of the request, giving the requester the\\nright to appeal.\\n\\nWhen NSA violated the first applicable time period,\\nGilmore filed an administrative appeal with the NSA\\'s FOIA\\nappeals authority.  There is also a time limit for response\\nto such appeals.  After this time limit passed without a\\nresponse from the NSA\\'s appeals authority, Gilmore filed\\na complaint in federal court in the Northern District of\\nCalifornia on Sept. 4, 1992, as permitted by the FOIA.\\n\\nGilmore\\'s complaint alleged three claims:  First, that the\\nNSA improperly withheld these documents from him, and\\nhad no legal basis for withholding; second, that the NSA\\'s\\nfailure to comply with the FOIA time limits constituted a\\nform of improper withholding; and third, that the NSA in\\ngeneral engages in an illegal pattern or practice of routinely\\nviolating the FOIA time limits, which should be declared\\nillegal and enjoined.\\n\\nIn the period between the initial FOIA request to NSA, and\\nthe filing of the complaint in federal court, Gilmore obtained\\ncopies of two of the withheld documents:  Military\\nCryptanalysis Parts III and IV, by Friedman.  These copies\\nwere discovered in libraries accessible to the general\\npublic and were provided by these libraries without any\\nkind of restriction.  Gilmore intended to get expert opinion\\non the national security risk posed by disclosure of these\\ndocuments.  He also reasoned that their very availability\\nin such libraries demonstrated that there could be no legal\\nbasis for withholding them from a FOIA requester.\\n\\nAt the time the documents were obtained, Gilmore had not\\nreceived any indication from NSA that the documents were\\nclassified.  It was therefore possible that the documents\\nwere not, in fact, classified.  In addition, FOIA requests for\\ndocuments generally trigger agency declassification review.\\nThus, even if the documents were in fact classified at the\\ntime of the request, it was possible that NSA would decide\\nthat they should no longer be classified, and release them\\nto Gilmore.\\n\\nAfter the complaint was filed, Gilmore not only served the\\ncomplaint upon NSA, he also served a number of discovery\\nrequests upon NSA, seeking to discover information about\\nboth the history of these documents and about NSA\\'s FOIA\\nprocessing procedures.\\n\\nIn early October, after NSA had received the complaint and\\nthe discovery requests, NSA finally sent its responses to\\nthe FOIA request.  NSA informed Gilmore that the documents\\nwere not going to be released to him.  NSA said that it had\\nlocated WF-3/4 and LC-3, but that LC-4/5/6 had never been\\ncompleted because of the death of Lambros Callimahos.\\n\\nFirst, NSA asserted that the three documents which did\\nexist were classified.  WF-3/4 were classified CONFIDENTIAL,\\nthe lowest level of classification under Executive Order\\n12,356 governing classified information.  LC-3 was\\nclassified SECRET, the middle level of classification.\\n\\nUnder the FOIA, an agency may withhold documents if they\\nare properly classified for reasons of national security.\\n\\nSecond, NSA asserted that the documents could also be\\nwithheld under a different exemption in the FOIA.  Under the\\n(b)(3) exemption, documents may be withheld if there exists\\na statute which authorizes an agency to withhold them.  NSA\\npointed to several statutes which arguably covered this\\nmaterial.  One of these statutes, 18 U.S.C. Section 798,\\nmakes it a federal crime knowingly to disclose classified \\ncryptologic or communications intelligence information to\\nunauthorized persons.\\n\\nAt this point, it became clear to Gilmore that there was a\\nproblem.  He now knew for a fact that the documents he had\\nwere classified (WF-3/4) and that it would be a crime for\\nhim to disseminate them.  He could no longer continue with\\nhis plan of showing them to other persons for fear of\\ncriminal prosecution.  He also feared that should NSA ever\\ndiscover that he possessed them, he would be subjected to\\nsearch and seizure and the copies confiscated.  (Note that\\nalthough the First Amendment Privacy Protection Act\\ngenerally protects the press against search and seizure\\nfor materials intended for publication where the crime\\ninvolves mere possession or dissemination of information,\\nit does not apply to any materials covered by the espionage\\nstatutes, of which 18 U.S.C. Section 798 is one.)\\n\\nNSA did not, however, know that he had them.  Gilmore\\ndecided that the best course of action was to submit copies\\nof WF-3/4 to the federal district court under seal.  By so\\ndoing, he would ensure that at least these copies would be\\nkept out of the NSA\\'s hands, since it was unlikely that a federal\\njudge would relinquish possession of documents material to\\npending litigation.  Thus, on November 12, Gilmore made an\\nex parte application to file these documents under seal with\\nJudge Thelton Henderson, the federal judge hearing his case.\\nGilmore also concurrently filed a motion for leave to amend\\nhis original complaint in order to address the constitutional\\nand other issues arising from his possession of the documents\\nand the criminality of disseminating documents found in\\nlibraries open to the general public.\\n\\nIt is important to realize that the criminal statute at issue\\nhere does not recognize improper classification as a defense.\\nUnder existing law, the government need only show that the\\ndocuments were classified by the government, and that they\\nare cryptologic- or communications-intelligence-related.  It\\nremains unclear precisely what the specific requirement\\nunder the statute is, i.e., whether \"knowingly\" means actual\\nknowledge of classification, or merely some reason to know.\\n\\n(That same day, NSA filed two motions of its own:\\na motion for a protective order blocking Gilmore\\'s discovery \\nrequests, and a motion for summary judgment asking the\\ncourt to dispose of the case on the ground that NSA was\\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.  In support of its\\nsummary judgment motion, NSA filed a sworn declaration\\nby Michael Smith, Chief of Policy, explaining why the\\ndocuments should be withheld, and why NSA\\'s FOIA\\nprocessing procedures were not illegal.)\\n\\nNSA was served with papers indicating that WF-3/4 had been\\nreceived by the district court.  This was the first time that\\nNSA knew that Gilmore possessed the documents.  They\\nreacted strongly.  John Martin, the Justice Department lawyer\\nrepresenting NSA, asked that Gilmore surrender his copies to\\nNSA, saying that NSA was very upset and might send its own\\nagents or FBI agents to get the copies from Gilmore.  He also\\nwanted to know where Gilmore got them.  Martin also suggested\\nthat Gilmore might be criminally liable under the espionage\\nstatutes relating to possession of national defense information.\\n\\nNSA regained its composure the next day, realizing that it\\ndid not know exactly what Gilmore had.  Although NSA had\\nbeen served with papers indicating what Gilmore had done,\\nGilmore had not sent them copies of the documents.  Thus\\nthey could not know for sure whether the documents he had\\nwere the ones they considered classified.  Gilmore agreed to\\nsend copies of his copies to NSA for their review, after\\nwhich NSA would decide what to do.\\n\\nDuring this period, tension was high.  Gilmore considered\\nfiling an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order\\nagainst NSA and the U.S. Attorney General to prevent them\\nfrom both moving against him personally and against any\\ncopies of the documents presently on library shelves.  This\\nmotion was drafted but never filed.\\n\\nOn the day before Thanksgiving, NSA announced that WF-3/4\\nwould be declassified, and effectively renounced any claim\\nthat it could withhold them from the public.  NSA gave no\\nofficial reason for its action.\\n\\nNSA is currently reviewing the third document, LC-3, to\\nsee how much of it can be released now that WF-3/4 have\\nbeen declassified.  (NSA had asserted in its summary judgment\\npapers that LC-3 was based on WF-3/4.)  NSA\\'s review is to\\nbe completed by January 15, 1993, at which time it will\\nrelease an edited version of LC-3 to Gilmore.\\n\\nIt is anticipated that this edited version of LC-3 will be\\nanalyzed by Gilmore and his experts, and that Gilmore and\\nNSA will engage in settlement negotiations to determine\\nwhether NSA has satisfied Gilmore\\'s request.  The\\nsettlement discussions will also include Gilmore\\'s claims\\nregarding NSA\\'s FOIA processing procedures.\\n\\nThe parties have stipulated that if no settlement is reached\\nthe litigation will proceed.  A status conference has been\\nset for February 9.  NSA will, if necessary, file an amended\\nmotion for summary judgment by February 12.  Following\\nopposition and reply briefs, the hearing on all motions will\\ntake place on March 22.\\n\\n[John Gilmore is a member of the EFF Board of Directors. He can\\nreached as gnu@cygnus.com.

May\\n                      (tcmay@netcom.com)\\n\\n\\nA specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto \\nanarchy. \\n\\nComputer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for \\nindividuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other \\nin a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange \\nmessages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts \\nwithout ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. \\nInteractions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-\\nrouting of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which \\nimplement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance \\nagainst any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far \\nmore important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. \\nThese developments will alter completely the nature of government \\nregulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the \\nability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of \\ntrust and reputation.\\n\\nThe technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social \\nand economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. \\nThe methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge \\ninteractive proof systems, and various software protocols for \\ninteraction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now \\nbeen on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences \\nmonitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently \\nhave computer networks and  personal computers attained sufficient \\nspeed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten \\nyears will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas \\neconomically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed \\nnetworks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band \\ntransmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips \\nnow under development will be some of the enabling technologies. \\n\\nThe State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this \\ntechnology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology \\nby drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. \\nMany of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow \\nnational secrets to be traded freely and will allow illicit and stolen \\nmaterials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will \\neven make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and \\nextortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users \\nof CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.\\n\\nJust as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of \\nmedieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will \\ncryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations \\nand of government interference in economic transactions. Combined \\nwith emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a \\nliquid market for any and all material which can be put into words \\nand pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed \\nwire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus \\naltering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the \\nfrontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an \\narcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which \\ndismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.\\n\\nArise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!\\n\\n\\n                   -==--==--==-<>-==--==--==-\\n\\n\\nDate: Wed, 02 Dec 92 21:31:47 -0800\\nFrom: haynes@cats.UCSC.EDU (Jim Haynes)\\nNewsgroups: comp.dcom.telecom\\nSubject: Historical Note on Telecom Privacy\\n\\nApropos of all the talk on FBI wiretapping, cellular eavesdropping,\\netc., I found this passage in \"Old Wires and New Waves\"; Alvin F.\\nHarlow; 1936.  He\\'s writing about unscrupulous telegraph operators in\\nthe early days.  They would use information in telegrams for personal\\ngain, or delay messages or news for personal gain, or sell news\\nreports to non-subscribers of the press association.\\n\\n    \"Pennsylvania passed a law in 1851, making telegrams secret,\\n    to prevent betrayal of private affairs by operators.  When,\\n    therefore, an operator was called into court in Philadelphia\\n    a little later, and ordered to produce certain telegrams which\\n    would prove an act of fraud, he refused to do so, saying that\\n    the state law forbade it.  The circuit court, shocked at this\\n    development, proceeded to override the law, saying:\\n\\n       It must be apparent that, if we adopt this construction\\n       of the law, the telegraph may be used with the most\\n       absolute security for purposes destructive to the\\n       well-being of society - a state of things rendering\\n       its absolute usefulness at least questionable.  The\\n       correspondence of the traitor, the murderer, the robber\\n       and the swindler, by means of which their crimes and\\n       frauds could be the more readily accomplished and\\n       their detection and punishment avoided, would become\\n       things so sacred that they never could be accessible to\\n       the public justice, however deep might be the public interest\\n       involved in their production.\\n    \\n    The judge therefore ordered the operator to produce the telegrams.\"\\n\\n\\n                   -==--==--==-<>-==--==--==-\\n\\n\\n         THE SECOND ANNUAL INTERNATIONAL EFF PIONEER AWARDS:\\n                       CALL FOR NOMINATIONS\\n                     Deadline: December 31,1992\\n\\nIn every field of human endeavor,there are those dedicated to expanding\\nknowledge,freedom,efficiency and utility.

Because of the possible legal repurcussions, I\\'d prefer\\nto remain anonymous at this time.  Thanks to the efforts of the people\\non this list, this is now possible.\\n\\nMy implementation is pretty far along.  It uses PGP modules for the\\narithmetic, so the speed is good.  It works on Unix and I should be\\nable to get it working on MSDOS in a day or two.  Sorry, I don\\'t have\\nthe ability to work on a Mac version.\\n\\nHere are some of the features.  The basic cash algorithm is the Chaum\\nsystem which was posted here.  Multiple denominations are supported,\\nusing different exponents for each denomination.  The program is\\npresented in the context of a package to be used for an email based\\ngame like Monopoly where the program would be used to allow cash\\ntransfers.  One player is the \"banker\", and he uses a different\\nexecution module than the other players.  The banker program keeps a\\ndatabase of used note numbers which is used to detect money reuse.\\nThe database is maintained using a freeware version of the \"dbm\"\\npackage, so it should be fast even for large note number databases.\\n\\nThe mapping between exponents and values is as follows:\\n\\n    exponent\\t    value\\n\\t17\\t\\t1\\n\\t19\\t\\t2\\n\\t23\\t\\t5\\n\\t29\\t\\t10\\n\\t31\\t\\t20\\n\\t37\\t\\t50\\n\\t41\\t\\t100\\n\\t43\\t\\t200\\n\\t47\\t\\t500\\n\\t53\\t\\t1000\\n\\t59\\t\\t2000\\n\\t61\\t\\t5000\\n\\t67\\t\\t10000\\n\\nand so on, up to a value of 2e9.  The exponents are ascending primes\\nstarting with 17.  This was chosen because you want them to be\\nsmallish for fast note checking, but it was too slow to find primes p\\nand q for the bank key such that (p-1)(q-1) was not divisible by any\\nsmall primes.  The program chooses random p and then tests p-1 to make\\nsure it passes the divisibility test, and rejects it if not.  Too many\\nwere being rejected when I started with an exponent of 3.  Starting\\nwith 17 rejects about 1/2 the exponents, compared to something like\\n80% when I started with 3.  The \"value\" fields are presumed to be\\ncents, but could be whatever you like.\\n\\nThe code I\\'ve written does not do anything other than the basic\\nelectronic cash algorithms.  It does not do bank account maintenance.\\nIt doesn\\'t do PGP encryption.  It doesn\\'t send mail.  (It does have\\nsome functions to scan and check the files created by the program.)\\n\\nCash generation is a 3 step process.  First, the user creates what I\\ncall a \"withdrawal request\" packet.  This is a set of triplets of the\\nform (e, s, refx), where e is the exponent from the table above, s is\\na 16-byte \"unique identifier\" used solely to link these withdrawal\\nrequests with the returned messages from the bank, and refx is r^e * f(x).\\nf(x) is MD5 of x, padded to the size of the bank\\'s modulus n using the\\nPGP routine which pads MD5 signatures.  This padding helps make sure the\\narithmetic is more \"mixing\".  x is the random input to MD5, which I\\'ve\\nchosen as 64 bytes since that is the block size MD5 works on.  (The\\noutput of MD5 is 16 bytes.)  r is the blinding factor.  This is now\\n128 bits long; longer r\\'s take too long to calculate r^-1 in the third\\nstep, below.  (It takes longer for PGP to calculate r^-1 than to do an\\nRSA decryption, for r = n = 1024 bits!)\\n\\nSecond, the bank program converts the withdrawal request packet into\\nwhat I call a \"withdrawal\" packet, by just RSA-decrypting the third\\nentry using the inverse exponent \"d\" for the value exponent \"e\".\\n(These \"d\" values are calculated at keygen time and stored with the\\nbank\\'s key information in a private file.)  I call the return triplet\\n(e, s, rfxd), where e is the value exponent again, s is the same\\nunique identifier, and rfxd is r * f(x)^d.\\n\\n(As I said above, the code I\\'ve written does not try to maintain\\naccount balances or do any other banking functions.  It just does the\\ncash algorithms.  There is a routine to scan a withdrawal request and\\nreturn the total value being requested for withdrawal.  The idea was\\nthat this could be used as input to a banking program to decide\\nwhether to allow the withdrawal.)\\n\\nThird, the \"player\" (e.g. user) program transforms the withdrawal\\npacket into a \"money\" packet, by un-blinding it.  To do this, it has\\nto recover the x and r which correspond with each triplet.  This is\\ndone by the use of a dbm database of \"pending withdrawal requests\"\\nwhich is written during step 1, above.  The database entries are keyed\\nby (e, s) and return the corresponding (x, r) which were generated\\nduring step 1.  Using x and r, the user transforms (e, s, rfxd) into\\n(e, x, fxd), the digital cash.  e is the value exponent, x is the\\nrandom 64-byte number, and fxd is f(x)^d, the signed version of the\\nMD5\\'d and padded x.\\n\\nThere are also player functions to scan and check a money file\\n(comparing a calculated f(x) to fxd^e), merge money files, and extract\\nsome items from a money file into another money file (this last is\\nwhat is to be used for payment).  There are banker functions to check\\nincoming money and compare against the used-note database, and to add\\nincoming money to that database.  (The database consists of the\\n16-byte f(x) values for each note.)\\n\\nI am pretty happy with the basic routines, but the user interface\\nneeds work.  There are three kinds of files floating around\\n(withdrawal requests, withdrawals, and money files) and I\\'m worried\\nthat this will be confusing to the user.  If he accidentally deletes\\none at the wrong time he could lose money permanently.  Or if he\\naccidentally reuses one he could be accused of fraud.  I\\'m not sure\\nwhat the best model is for the user.\\n\\nThe specific issues of creating withdrawal messages and extracting\\n\"bills\" from a money file are areas where the user interface should be\\nmade nice.  We want to make it easy for the user to specify exactly\\nwhat denominations he wants to work with.  One possibility is to\\nsimply have him input the amount (e.g. $10.55) and the program\\ncalculates that that\\'s a 1000, a 50, and a 5, but this isn\\'t really\\nflexible enough.  A nice system would be to give him a list of options\\nand let him fill out a form on-screen, but that\\'s hard to do portably.\\n\\nAnother idea I\\'ve had is that there should be a special money file\\ncalled the user\\'s \"wallet\" which is the default place where incoming\\nmoney from the bank should go.  This might help organize things.  He\\nstill needs to be able to create other money files for paying other\\npeople, and remembering to delete them after he sends them.\\n\\nAny suggestions or thoughts on these interface issues, or comments\\nabout how this program could or should be integrated into a larger\\nsystem, would be appreciated.\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nVersion: 2.0\\n\\nmQCNAisiUPkAAAED/i1Pf1DaubveDsgjh360rNJ7kWkhssobaVmmWa70l4lOTwy/\\nsGwhJaA+JdScO9g3B66DIAaU0GiNrTS4YEl/b5ohNDZFdqKlxZ7NW9A5JYjUlhGE\\na53cRwqUXs42kbPbMh/uKxXBgbUnKrKZnWAh29irDWb+G8OEPQrkCJ6S8691AAUR\\ntAl4UGhhZWRydXM=\\n=HVRq\\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: nobody@rebma.rebma.mn.org\\nDate: Sat, 12 Dec 92 14:04:53 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: no subject (file transmission)\\nMessage-ID: <m0n0efX-0006XfC@rebma.rebma.mn.org>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\n\\nUpdate on the digital cash project\\n\\nI am having some problems with the port to MSDOS, mostly due to\\nimplicitly assuming 32-bit integers in a few places.  Probably I won\\'t\\nget it working until next weekend.\\n\\nTo recap, the program provides Chaum-style digital cash via two\\nexecutables, one for the \"players\" and one for the \"banker\".  The\\nbanker creates a public key which has a single modulus n and multiple\\nexponents, the prime numbers starting with 17.  He sends n to the\\nplayers and all is ready.\\n\\nPlayers withdraw money by running their programs and specifying the\\ndenominations they want to withdraw.  For example, you could withdraw\\na 1, two 5\\'s, a 10 and a 20.  This would create a file with 5 entries\\nto be sent to the bank.  PGP should be used to encrypt and\\nascii-encode this file (for privacy) and it should be mailed to the\\nbanker.\\n\\nThe banker receives this file and runs his program to RSA-sign the\\nvalues in each of the withdrawal-request entries.  This is the\\n\"blinded cash\" that Chaum describes.  Again, PGP should be used for\\nmailing this back to the user.\\n\\nThe player then has to \"unblind\" the file to make it \"real\" digital\\ncash.  This also changes it so that the bank won\\'t recognize it when\\nit is deposited.  He uses his version of the program to do this,\\nproducing an actual digital money file with the five \"digital bills\"\\nin it.\\n\\nTo pay another user, he runs another function to extract the desired\\nbills from this file.  Suppose he wants to extract a 1 and a 5.  This\\nleaves a 5, a 10 and a 20 in the original file, and creates a new\\ndigital cash file with a 1 and a 5.  He would then use PGP again to\\nencrypt this for safety and mail it to the person he wants to pay.\\n\\nThat person can run a \"check\" function on the incoming digital money\\nto make sure it has a proper bank signature on it and is not a\\nforgery.  He would then mail it directly to the bank so that it could\\nget credited to his account.\\n\\nThe banker runs his program which checks the signatures on the\\nincoming money, looks in a database file to make sure these bills\\nhaven\\'t been used before, and adds these bills to the database.  (The\\ndatabase stores 16 bytes per bill.)  He should then record the deposit\\nand perhaps send a confirmation to the depositor (my program doesn\\'t\\nget involved with that).\\n\\nI hope this gives a clearer picture of how the electronic money\\nprogram works.  It is a simple implementation but I think many systems\\nwould work similarly.\\n\\nI appreciated the suggestion to use cash as part of the list\\nmanagement itself.  Rather than paying people who post, I wonder if it\\nwould be better to make people pay to post.  Many people have\\ncomplained about the volume.  :)  Unfortunately, I suspect that this\\nwould involve too much overhead for the mailing list maintainer.\\n\\nMaybe the thing to do is to just get the software out there and let\\npeople decide what they want to do with it (if anything).  I\\'m\\nprobably going to take a couple more weeks to clean up the user\\ninterface and get these bugs out, then I\\'ll try sending it someone to\\nbe put on the cypherpunks ftp archive.\\n\\nIt\\'s nice to be able to finally sign these messages!\\n\\n- -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\nmQCNAisiUPkAAAED/i1Pf1DaubveDsgjh360rNJ7kWkhssobaVmmWa70l4lOTwy/\\nsGwhJaA+JdScO9g3B66DIAaU0GiNrTS4YEl/b5ohNDZFdqKlxZ7NW9A5JYjUlhGE\\na53cRwqUXs42kbPbMh/uKxXBgbUnKrKZnWAh29irDWb+G8OEPQrkCJ6S8691AAUR\\ntAl4UGhhZWRydXM=\\n=HVRq\\n- -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\niQCVAgUBKyZADQrkCJ6S8691AQHneQP8DRdkOFfG9TwjGDJAX4IxymvzAITqYIJC\\naMhytyzqFwP6Dku955ZHEPL1SDpNCU8DwK7eKDOgvHRS3m+kihs1l6VR3Gf0AgGw\\n7jjRJlt7hcqfT16fLHVXtn27A16rUhl2hKrD702wjGzX+MN7mS/8MW2kchVfvQYX\\nM/McOuwuIjs=\\n=/HGX\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Bill O\\'Hanlon <wmo@rebma.rebma.mn.org>\\nDate: Sat, 12 Dec 92 15:44:58 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Remailer problem at rebma fixed\\nMessage-ID: <m0n0g5G-0006bMC@rebma.rebma.mn.org>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\nMy apologies to those who have used PGP with the remailer at rebma\\nover the past week.

What follows is some design \\ndiscussion, a protocol specification that defines the interaction,\\nmessage format, and file formats, followed by notes, and plans for\\nfuture enhancements.  A basic familiarity with the concept of dc-nets is\\nassumed, for people new to this, see Chaums\\'s article on the topic,\\nposted here recently.\\n\\nI am assuming interaction through e-mail because this is, right now,\\nthe most accessible medium.  A more efficient approach would be to\\nuse a true broadcast media, such as coax cable, or satellite.  But\\ncoax only works for local areas, and not everyone has satellite uplink\\ncapability.\\n\\nIn the future, I envision all or most local area networks running their\\nown small dc-nets that use ethernet broadcast, these being linked\\nhierarchically to medium-level dc-nets that use any internet type of\\ncommunication medium (udp datagrams, tcp connections, smtp, usenet news,\\nshared ftp space, etc) or other regional communication such as radio\\n(amateur packet radio, spread-spectrum, or even CB) , and these finally\\nbeing linked into global dc-nets that use satellite broadcast.  \\n\\nThis type of system would achieve the truly anonymous global communication\\nsystem, similar to what Vinge describes in True Names:\\n\\n      He dumped the last twenty-four hours of the world bulletin\\n      board into his home memory space and began checking through\\n      it.  The bulletin board was ideal for untraceable reception\\n      of messages: anyone on Earth could leave a message [...] If \\n      a user copied the entire board, and /then/ searched it, there\\n      was no outside record of exactly what information he was\\n      interested in.  There were also simple ways to make nearly \\n      untraceable entries on the board.\\n\\nDC-nets will remove the \"nearly\" from the last sentence.\\n\\nThe system I am writing is for research purposes only, I would like to \\nhave about 6 to 8 people running it, and then observe it in action. \\nI am not aware of any existing, operational dc-net.  If you know of\\none, please let me know.  I would not like to develop a new, incompatible\\nprotocol if it is not fundamentally better than something existing.\\n\\nThe dc-net system is independent of how the keys are distributed/created.\\nThis system assumes that there is already a key stream existing between\\nany two users, that it can use.\\n\\nThere are several methods by which keys can be distributed.  The most\\nsecure would probably be to use a hardware RNG to generate a one-time\\npad, which is then trasfered by some secure means (exchanged on floppies\\nin person, or put on a 4GB DAT tape (4mm, $20 or less) and sent by\\nsome courier service, etc).  Another possibility is to use\\nDiffie-Hellman protocol to agree on a set of keys.  The simplest method,\\nand one I chose to use in this project, is to generate a random key\\nstream, encrypt it with the other person\\'s public key, sign it with\\nyours, and send it through e-mail.  See the next message for details\\non message formats used for this.  \\n\\nAgain, the core dc-net system described in this message is in no way\\ndependent on this form of key exchange.  Any other key distribution\\nmethod can be \"dropped in\" without changing anything.\\n\\nThe design document follows:\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nALGORITHM (pseudocode):\\n\\nThis algorithm is executed independently by each participant.  The list\\nof participants, RBSIZE, and MSGSIZE must be agreed on beforehand.  There\\nmust be an existing keystream, or a way to receive one.\\n\\nBegin Round (increment round number)\\n\\nStage 1 (reservation):\\n    Take RBSIZE bits off everyone\\'s pad, xor all together.\\n    For every message you need to send, reverse a random bit.\\n    Sign with your public key, and transmit to all.\\n    When received everyone\\'s block, xor all together.\\n    If result is all zeros, round ends.  Go on to the next round.\\n\\nStage 2 (transmission):\\n    For every \\'1\\' bit in reservation block:\\n\\n    Begin Message (increment message number)\\n\\n        Take MSGSIZE bits off everyone\\'s pad, xor all together.\\n        If the bit was reserved by you, xor with your message.\\n        Sign with your public key, transmit to all.\\n        When received everyone\\'s block, xor all together, getting message.\\n        If message was yours, verify it, mark it as sent.\\n        If not, it is a message from someone else. Process as an incoming\\n\\tmessage.\\n\\n    End Message (go to next set bit of reservation block if any)\\n\\nEnd Round (go to next round, optionally delay to save bandwidth)\\n\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMESSAGE FORMAT:\\n\\n(messages are sent as signed, armored, non-encrypted PGP messages)\\n\\n Subject: dc-net transmission\\n\\n DCNET <network>; ROUND <round>; PARTICIPANT <userid>; STAGE <stage> [MSG <n>]\\n\\n <binary data stream follows>\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFILE FORMATS:\\n\\ndcnet/<netname>/myname\\n\\n    your own participant name for that network\\n\\n\\ndcnet/<netname>/participants       \\n\\n    list of participants and addresses in the following format:\\n\\n         <userid>:<address>\\n\\n\\ndcnet/<netname>/pad/<participant>\\n\\n    one-time pad for the user, straight 8-bit binary data\\n        optionally pgp-encrypted with your public key, signed to prevent\\n        disclosure and tampering; these options not implemented yet\\n\\n\\ndcnet/<netname>/spool/<stage>/<participant>\\n\\n        spool where you store responses received, until you receive\\n        all of them.

But it could\\n        also drop it into another net\\'s outgoing directory if it\\n        matches some criteria, or it could be posted to a newsgroup,\\n        or anything else you want to do.\\n\\n\\ndcnet/<netname>/log\\n\\n        this file contains log of transmissions received times and sizes.\\n        it should only contain public information, so it can be posted\\n        for analysis of net efficiency, bandwidth used, etc.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNOTES:\\n\\nI must thank the ILF (Information Liberation Front) for their timely post\\nof Chaum\\'s article.  I had started with the two-person example provided\\nin the cypherpunks glossary, and independently extended it to apply to\\nany number of participants, and had progressed up to the idea of\\nhierarchial dc-nets, and was struggling with the question of collision\\ndetection, when the article was posted.  Chaum\\'s reservation blocks are\\nan elegant and efficient solution.  His formal proof of security is\\nalso reassuring.\\n\\nRBSIZE is the number of bits in the reservation block.  This should be\\nmuch larger than number of participants, to minimize the chance of\\ntwo participants randomly reserving the same bit (in which case the\\ntransmission has to be retried in the next round).  A convenient number\\nto use is 1024 bites (128bytes), if the number of users is small.\\n\\nWhen operating in idle mode (no messages to be sent), RBSIZE bits are\\nsent to each participant each round. So the total bandwidth used is,\\nassuming 1kbit RBSIZE, 25 participants, and two rounds an hour, about\\n150 kilobytes per day sent and received by each participant, or about 14\\nbits per second.  This is quite insignificant, considering today\\'s \\ncommunication equipment.  \\n\\nMSGSIZE is the size of a message.  This should be about the size of an\\naverage message, not the largest one.  Making this too large will waste\\nbandwidth.  I will use message size of 5kilobytes.  This is quite\\nsmall, but enough for research purposes.  This will make the messages\\nseveral screenfuls long.  Longer messages can be split into parts, and\\nreassembled.  For example, this message would be split into two parts.\\n\\nFor each message that is sent, the number of bytes that every every\\nparticipant must send and receive is MSGSIZE times the number of \\nparticipants (using the above assumptions, 125 kilobytes).\\n\\nUsing a true broadcast media would dramatically reduce these bandwidth\\nrequirements, making large-scale systems with many participants\\nfeasible.\\n\\nThis implementation uses a <netname> to distinguish between separate\\ndc-nets a user may be participating in.  A netname can be any string, \\nsubject to filename limitations.  Keeping them alphanumeric and under 14\\nchars should work on most machines.. They might also be case insensitive.\\n\\nNetnames do not have to be globally unique, one person just can not be on\\ntwo nets of the same name.\\n\\nPersons are referenced to by <participant>, which would normally be the\\nusername but can be an arbitrary string subject to the same limitations.\\nTwo perople with the same participand name can not be on one dc-net.\\n\\nAre any of you amateur radio (HAM) operators?  I would be interested if\\nthis system could be run over packet radio.  Are there any regulations\\nagainst encrypted traffic?  \\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:\\n\\nIn addition to mail-based interaction, usenet newsgroups, ethernet broadcasts,\\nshared ftp access, and tcp connections should be supported.  \\n\\nA protocol for dynamically adding participants to the net, removing\\noneself from the net, or changing the address should exist.\\n\\nA way to deal with malfunctions, such as not receiving a message from\\na participant.

The dc-net just\\nreads the keystream from a file, and calls a program when it is about to\\nrun out of keys, and needs more.  \\n\\nThis message describes the method of key distribution I will use.  I assume\\nthat all participants know each others\\' public keys, and have verified such\\nby independent means, or they are signed by mutually trusted certifiers.\\nPGP encryption is used to send randomly generated one-time pad.  Two\\nparticipants send keys to each other whenever the remaining key stream \\nreaches below an agreed-upon threshold, then the keys are combined in a\\npre-determined way (no matter which one sent his message first, the result\\nwill be the same).  Keys are transferred in large chunks, larger than the\\nnormal message size, so that these trasfers would not have to be too\\nfrequent.  \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nMESSAGE FORMAT:\\n\\n(messages are sent as signed, armored encrypted PGP messages)\\n\\n  Subject: dc-net transmission\\n\\n  DCNET <network>; PARTICIPANT <userid>; KEYCHUNK <n>\\n\\n  <binary data follows>\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nALGORITHM:\\n\\nWhen remaining keystream for <userid> on dcnet <network> falls below\\nMINTHRESHOLD, increment keychunk number (n), generate CHUNKSIZE random\\nbits, encrypt and sign them, and send them to the other person.\\n\\nWait for the other participant\\'s message.  Decrypt it, and verify the\\nsignature. \\n\\nCompare the two key chunks (the one you sent, and the one you received),\\nand order them by placing the one with lower value first.\\n\\nAppend them in the above order to the key file.\\n\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\nNOTES:\\n\\nIf both persons use the same MINTHRESHOLD and CHUNKSIZE, then they should\\nsend their messages at approximately the same time, but there is no\\nguarantee of which one will arrive first.  If a keychunk is received before\\none has been sent, one is generated and sent, and then compared to the\\nreceived key.\\n\\nFor the sake of simplicity, I will assume everyone will use the same\\nCHUNKSIZE and MINTHRESHOLD.  This is not a requirement, and the proper\\noperation of the system in now way depends on this.\\n\\nThe purpose of MINTHRESHOLD is to provide a safety margin, so that key\\nexchange would not interfere with the regular operation of the dc-net.\\n\\nIn choosing CHUNKSIZE and MINTHRESHOLD, the basic tradeoff is space versus\\ntime.  Maximizing these values will reduce the number of transmissions,\\npossibly making more efficient bulk transmission methods possible.  But, it\\nwill increase the storage requirements of each participant.\\n\\nEach participant will need to store at most\\n\\n(MINTHRESHOLD+CHUNKSIZE) * <number of participants>\\n\\nEach participant will need to obtain new keys approximately every \\n\\nRBSIZE/CHUNKSIZE of idle rounds, or MSGSIZE/CHUNKSIZE of messages\\ntransmitted.\\n\\nFor this project I will choose a CHUNKSIZE of 75K, allowing for 600 idle\\nrounds, or 15 messages transmitted.\\n\\nMINTHRESHOLD will be 150K.  The storage requirements will be about\\n2 megabytes of a net of 8 participants, or about 5 megabytes for a net\\nof 25 participants.\\n\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFUTURE ENCHANCEMENTS:\\n\\nA more efficient bulk-transfer method may be used, such as dropping the\\nchunks off to a known ftp site.  As soon as the chunk is picked up, it is\\ndeleted.  Many ftp sites have such \"temporary\", \"incoming\", or \"dropoff\"\\ndirectories.  Many sites could be agreed on, in case one fails.  All\\nparticipants should not use the same site, so as not to cause too much load\\non any single machine.\\n\\nSome method of randomizing the key transfer could be used, so all\\nparticipants would not run out of keys at the same time, causing\\nunneccessary load on the mail transport system.\\n\\nIf a broadcast medium is used, an efficient variant of Diffey-Hellmann\\ncan be used, in which each participant needs to generate only one secret\\nrandom number, and publish the corresponding public value.  Then every one\\ncan combine it with their secret value, in a way that results in each pair\\nof participants having a common secret key unknown to anyone else.\\n\\nIf feasible, one-time-pads can be transferred in person, using floppy\\ndisks.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\nAgain, I would appreciate any ideas, comments, suggestions at:\\n\\n\\n--\\nYanek Martinson    mthvax.cs.miami.edu!safe0!yanek     uunet!medexam!yanek\\nthis address preferred -->> yanek@novavax.nova.edu <<-- this address preferred\\nPhone (305) 765-6300 daytime   FAX: (305) 765-6708  1321 N 65 Way/Hollywood\\n      (305) 963-1931 evenings       (305) 981-9812  Florida, 33024-5819\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: yanek@novavax.nova.edu (Yanek Martinson)\\nDate: Sun, 13 Dec 92 16:18:58 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Yes they exist (re: Electronic P.O.Boxes)\\nMessage-ID: <9212140014.AA21225@novavax.nova.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nSuch systems do exist.

An experimental server has been setup and\\nyou are encouraged to use it.\\n\\nThere are many anonymous posting services in existence which provide\\nanonymous electronic mail and posting to specific newsgroups where\\nposting is sometimes harmful to one\\'s health or reputation ! Such\\nservices allow you to:\\n\\n - post anonymously to those news groups\\n\\n - reply anonymously to posts by email\\n\\n - converse anonymously with another anonymous user, neither of\\n   you knowing your real identities\\n\\nPrivacy-enhanced electronic mail refers to the concept of encrypting\\none\\'s mail prior to sending it off into the ether, presumably to\\nsomeone at the other end capable of decrypting it. If one uses a\\nso-called \"public key\" method of encryption, then one can make one\\'s\\n\"public\" key widely known so that anyone can encrypt mail to you, but only\\nyou can decrypt it using your \"secret\" key. There is much development\\ngoing on in this area, but one quite popular public-domain implementation\\nis Philip Zimmermann\\'s \"Pretty Good Privacy 2.0\" which makes use of a\\nnumber of cryptographic methods including the RSA algorithm in places\\n(See Legal Issues later on). PGP allows you to:\\n\\n - exchange public keys with another individual\\n\\n - encode messages to them that only they can read\\n\\n - receive messages from them that only you can read\\n\\nThese tools are all very well for the specific purposes for which they\\nwere designed, but unfortunately your anonymous message or post is not\\nactually anonymous until it gets to the machine that host\\'s the service.\\nAnyone in between, including your own administrators, can in theory\\nread your post, even though they won\\'t know to whom it is directed. What\\nis more they can also read replies addressed back to you. This can be\\nhighly embarrassing at best, and result in dismissal or disconnection\\nat worst if your thoughts, beliefs or activities are disapproved of by\\nthe powers that be, even if they are perfectly legal.\\n\\nPAX\\'s privacy-enhanced anonymous services were conceived in the belief\\nthat free speech and privacy are fundamental rights and that it is\\nhigh time the networks to which we are connected provided such services\\non a routine basis. Seeing as they don\\'t we have to make a start somewhere.\\n\\nThis service provides:\\n\\n - conventional anonymous mailing and posting services via a \"normal\"\\n   alias assigned in the usual fashion\\n\\n - the ability to post to ANY newsgroup that is carried out of PAX\\n   (which includes most non-regional groups)\\n\\n - PGP 2.0 based privacy-enhanced mail & posting, including:\\n\\n   - ability to register your \"public\" key with PAX, so that PAX\\n     can send encrypted messages to you\\n\\n   - local generation of a unique public key which is sent to you,\\n     so that you can send encrypted messages to PAX\\n\\n   - any encoded messages from you mailed to a user or newsgroup are\\n     decrypted at PAX before being passed on in anonymous form\\n\\n   - any anonymous replies to your \"pgp\" alias are encrypted before\\n     being mailed to you\\n\\nFor example, once you have obtained your PGP 2.0 software (as described\\nlater) and got it going, and once you have generated and registered\\nyour public key and received PAX\\'s key in response, you will be able\\nto post to any newsgroup without anyone beyond your machine having\\naccess to the plaintext of your post.\\n\\nFurthermore, if another user has registered in the same manner, and\\nyou know their anonymous alias or are responding to one of their\\nanonymous posts, even though you don\\'t know who they are and haven\\'t\\nexchanged keys to communicate directly, the PAX service will automatically\\ndecrypt any encrypted messages from you and re-encrypt them before\\npassing them on to the other person !\\n\\n How to use it.\\n ==============\\n\\nAll transactions are handled by email, and commands are selected by\\nthe name of the alias to which you mail, not by the subject or body\\nof the message (which are ignored unless sending or posting a message).\\nThe separator between the \"anon\" and the command is a dot (period,\\'.\\')\\nand nothing else will work ! Not \\'-\\', not \\'_\\', not \":\", only a dot.\\n\\nThe site to address mail is \"pax.tpa.com.au\". If this fails for some\\nreason, you may need to address it to the specific host (at present)\\nie. \"flash.pax.tpa.com.au\".\\n\\n\"Normal\" (unencrypted) commands:\\n\\n - To get information (this message):\\n\\n    mail anon.info@pax.tpa.com.au\\n\\n - To see what your \"normal\" alias is, or get one:\\n\\n    mail anon.ping@pax.tpa.com.au\\n\\n - To send a reply to another anonymous user:\\n\\n    mail anon.###@pax.tpa.com.au\\n\\n    NB:\\n      - eg. mail anon.36@pax.tpa.com.au\\n\\n      - don\\'t be creative ... anon.036 won\\'t work\\n\\n      - an attempt is made to strip off signature lines by discarding\\n        everything after a line starting with \"--\" or \"__\"\\n\\n - To send a post to a newsgroup:\\n\\n    mail anon.post.groupname@pax.tpa.com.au\\n\\n    NB:\\n      - eg. \"mail anon.post.talk.abortion\" will send a\\n        post to \"talk.abortion\"\\n\\n      - only the Subject field from your post is used, the rest of\\n        the header is discarded\\n\\n      - the newsgroup is selected by the alias; Newsgroup header\\n        fields are discarded; hence cross-posting isn\\'t feasible\\n\\n      - signatures are stripped as above\\n\\n\"PGP\" (encryption) commands:\\n\\n - To register your public key with PAX: (ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY)\\n\\n    mail anon.key@pax.tpa.com.au\\n\\n    NB:\\n      - first you have to make install pgp and make a key then send it\\n        in a \"anon.key\" command\\n\\n      - the body of the message MUST contain an ascii encoded public key\\n        generated by PGP V2.0. You may use your regular public key that\\n        you give to other people if you wish. The user ID name must be\\n        unlikely to conflict with one PAX already has, so use your full\\n        name, or include your email address or something. If you want\\n        you can use a unique key just for PAX - it makes no difference.\\n        If PAX already has a key of the same user-id it will reject yours.\\n        Note that this means that you need different key user-id\\'s on\\n        different machines (or mail addresses anyway).\\n\\n        # makes new keys & adds to your \"keyring\"\\n        pgp -kg\\n        Enter a user ID for your public key: First M. Last of somefirm\\n\\n        # extract key in ascii form suitable for a message body\\n        pgp -kxa \"First M. Last of somefirm\" savedfile pubring\\n\\n        # send it to PAX\\n        mail anon.key@pax.tpa.com.au <savedfile.asc\\n\\n      - PAX will respond by sending you a new alias number and a\\n        public key to add to your keyring to use to encrypt messages\\n        to PAX. It will have a user ID name of \"paxanon.publickey\"\\n        and you should add it to your public key ring by saving the\\n        message in a file and presenting it as follows:\\n\\n        pgp -ka savedfile\\n\\n        Your life will be easier in future if you reply yes to the\\n        certify question.\\n\\n      - Note that now you may have two aliases, that sent in response to\\n        the anon.key command and that sent in response to the anon.ping\\n        command or previous unencrypted replies or posts. Any sunsequent\\n        replies or posts that you encrypt before sending will be seen\\n        to others as having come from the new alias, and replies will be\\n        encrypted before being passed on to you. Any plaintext messages\\n        you send will appear to have come from the original alias and\\n        responses will also come back in plaintext.\\n\\n - Sending encrypted posts and replies.\\n\\n     There are no other commands. If you encrypt a message and send it\\n     using the \"anon.reply\" and \"anon.post\" groups, the software will\\n     detect that they are encrypted, select the appropriate alias as\\n     a return address, decrypt the message, and mail or post it.\\n\\n     You should use PGP 2.0 to encrypt messages sent to PAX, using\\n     the public key that PAX sent to you. DON\\'T FORGET TO SIGN your\\n     message using the secret key corresponding to the public key\\n     that you sent to PAX !!! Unsigned messages will be rejected\\n     to ensure that the message is really from you and not someone\\n     pretending to be you using your account or mailpath.\\n\\n     Eg.:\\n\\n        # sign and encrypt message for mailing to pax.\\n        pgp -east message \"paxanon.publickey\" -u \"First M. Last of somefirm\"\\n        mail -s \"A test post\" anon.post.alt.test <message.asc\\n\\n     Note the -a (armor) and -t (text) options. Note also the subject\\n     flag to mail - PAX will whinge if you post something without a\\n     subject.\\n\\n     Similarly, all messages to you will be signed using PAX\\'s secret\\n     key corresponding to the public key PAX sent to you, hence you\\n     will know if the message really came from PAX and not someone\\n     else using your public key.\\n\\n     ***** NB. The ENTIRE encrypted segment will be passed on after\\n     it has been decrypted. There is no processing of any contained\\n     header (though it won\\'t work as a header), nor any removal of\\n     signature information within the encrypted text. Take great care\\n     to ensure that there is no identifying information within the\\n     encrypted text. *****\\n\\n     Any plain text accompanying the encrypted text will be discarded.\\n     The Subject header field is still passed on during postings as\\n     with \"normal\" unencrypted posts.\\n\\n     More work may be done on these \"features\" if there is sufficient\\n     demand for it :).\\n\\nMiscellaneous administrative commands:\\n\\n - To see the current status of the system (message of the day):\\n\\n    mail anon.status@pax.tpa.com.au\\n\\n - To send mail to a human administrator:\\n\\n    mail anon.admin@pax.tpa.com.au\\n\\n Mailing List\\n ============\\n\\nTo send mail to/join/unjoin a mailing list about this service, and\\nanonymous services in general:\\n\\n    mail anon.list@pax.tpa.com.au\\n    mail anon.subscribe@pax.tpa.com.au\\n    mail anon.unsubscribe@pax.tpa.com.au\\n\\n\\n How secure is it ?\\n ==================\\n\\nNot bad. Clearly it depends on the security of the underlying PGP 2.0\\nsoftware which is discussed at length in its documentation.\\n\\nThe keys are stored, and the messages encrypted and decrypted on\\na server which also hosts a Public Access Unix system. These files\\nare protected by the usual Unix security mechanisms, but in the\\nevent of a security breach could conceivably become visible. The\\nkeys would hence be compromised and any messages passing through\\ncould be decrypted. The PAX administration could theoretically\\naccess the keys and files at will of course.\\n\\nIt is hard to conceive of an alternative implementation which links\\nanonymity with privacy enhancement however. This is no substitute for\\na direct person to person link with certified keys and this service\\nshould not be used as a substitute for such if security is a primary\\nconcern.\\n\\n Legal Issues.\\n =============\\n\\nPGP 2.0\\'s use of the RSA algorithm is a problem in the US where a patent\\nis now held on the algorithm, despite its widespread promulgation before\\nthe patent was obtained. The PGP documentation discusses this issue at\\nlength.\\n\\nSufficeth to say, this service is provided by a site in Australia and\\nhence should not be subject to the constraints imposed by the US patent.\\nThe service is offered to anyone who can reach this site by mail, in\\naddition to PAX\\'s own users, and there is no intention of obtaining any\\ncommercial gain by providing the privacy-enhanced anonymous service.\\n\\nWhether individuals in the US can legally use the PGP software to use the\\nservice provided by PAX for their own personal use, without first obtaining\\na license to use the RSA algorithm is an untested issue.

The sooner we start playing with this technology,\\nthe better.\\n\\nI have a few general comments about the system.  First, I like the\\nidea of splitting the key information management from the communication\\nmanagement.  That way people can choose their level of security, all\\nthe way up to one-time pads if they want.\\n\\nHowever, I think there should be another system chosen for exchanging\\nkey information initially than using PGP to send large one-time pads.\\nDc-nets really eat up the bandwidth.  Yanek estimates using 125\\nkb per message sent!  And having to send one-time key information\\naround doubles the bandwidth.\\n\\nAlso, Eric Hughes pointed out to me in private mail once that a system\\nlike this for key information exchange is only computationally secure.\\nYou are basically relying on RSA and IDEA not to be broken.  As long\\nas you\\'re doing that for this initial experiment, why not save yourself\\na lot of trouble.  Just exchange an IDEA (or DES) seed, then cycle it\\nrepeatedly through IDEA (or DES), taking the low order bit or few bits\\nas new random ones.  If two people have the same seed, they will generate\\nthe same random bits.  And if IDEA is secure, your bits should be\\nsecure.  If they aren\\'t, PGP isn\\'t secure.  PGP has code to do this.\\nI think it\\'s in the IDEA.C module.  Also see strong_pseudorandom in\\nCRYPTO.C.\\n\\nSo, I\\'d suggest that the key exchange part just exchange a short key\\nand then a program generates the new random bits as needed for the\\nmessaging.  Keep the key stuff separate, though, so people really can\\ndo one-time pads if they want to eventually.\\n\\nAnother point is the amount of messaging people will do.  I think the\\nsystem should be enhanced to allow people to send and receive messages\\nto/from non-DC-net participants.  Otherwise you have 10 or 20 people\\nwho hardly know each other.  What will they have to say to each other?\\nYou won\\'t get a good picture of message loads.\\n\\nI don\\'t foresee everybody in the world being hooked into interlocking\\nDC-nets any time soon (if ever).  But I do think there will be DC-nets\\nfor some interested people.  They will achieve anonymity amongst\\nthe group for messages sent beyond the group.  In other words, it will\\nbe known that a message comes from a certain DC-net group, but it will\\nbe impossible to tell which person in the group sent it.  Likewise,\\nmessages could be sent to a DC-net group without it being known to whom\\nthey are sent.\\n\\nI think this capability should be added very soon to the DC-net software.\\nIt sounds like the software may include automatic message-sending capability\\nand if so, something which just recognized a special message header and\\ntook it as \"Request-Remailing-To:\" should be easy to add.  Likewise,\\nincoming messages to the Dc-net (which would be sent to some random\\nperson in the group) should be easily forwardable to the DC-net system\\nfrom outside.  I don\\'t have a clear picture of the user interface from\\nYanek\\'s description so I\\'m not sure how easy/hard these would be to do.\\n\\nOne other thing I\\'d mention: the mechanism of reserving a slot and then\\nsending a message is discussed at some length in the Ph.D. thesis of\\nJurgen Bos.  Tim May kindly sent me an excerpt from the thesis which\\nincluded this discussion; I think it may have been part of the original\\ncypherpunk meeting handout.  Bos compares several message reservation\\nschemes and discusses which are the best.  It might be good for Yanek\\nto take a look at this document.\\n\\nYanek asks about sending encrypted traffic over amateur bands.  This\\nis definately illegal in the U.S.  The reason is that the amateur bands\\ncan\\'t be used for commercial purposes, so the FCC demands to be able\\nto know everything that is being sent to make sure this rule is being\\ncomplied with.  However, there are some commercial packet-radio systems\\nstarting up and presumably they won\\'t be subject to this limitation.\\n\\nIt may not be practical to incorporate all of these suggestions at first,\\nbut I do think that using PGP to exchange a RNG seed would be better\\nthan using it to exchange one-time pads.  I\\'m looking forward to seeing\\nthe system in operation.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\niQCVAgUBKyvk8qgTA69YIUw3AQHyuQP/fXIkyCWR5GCiZsiRvMThcJK5xMbOQEIF\\now9S9xQ+7kiiJuF4dVp7NRyNTBjO2tBiQDh4JRKb4Pl7LGq+KKYQSTDzGgEo7hOw\\ndkgujwxbCAXjn2XEMewRHprZMPV4XB+iGIZzQ4piqubzWg8hOV8sMhduGaHKnhGc\\nMlhbbmhToOc=\\n=+cPN\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n\\nDistribution:\\n  CYPHERPUNKS >INTERNET:CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: dclunie@pax.tpa.com.AU (David Clunie)\\nDate: Sun, 13 Dec 92 16:09:59 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: Random numbers\\nMessage-ID: <9212131408.AA00292@britt>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n>     It has lately been discussed different ways to construct pure\\n> random number generators by means of radiactive decay.

Every message is assumed to be 5K so bandwidth is\\nwasted for any message smaller than that.  As I mentioned in \"FUTURE \\nENHANCEMENTS\" section, I will make message size be part of the reservation\\nblock structure, so small messages will be transferred more efficiently.\\n\\nSecond, I am using point-to-point transmission.  When I want to broadcast\\na message, I need to send it individually to each participant.

I was\\nable to confirm that his messages had come in and been sent out.\\n\\nHowever, another possible reason is for the case of abusive messages.\\nI had one message go through that appeared to be directed towards\\nthe sender\\'s boss, and was rather unfriendly in tone.  The remailers\\ngive the outgoing messages the superficial appearance of having\\ncome from me.  This message wasn\\'t that bad, but there\\'s nothing\\nto stop someone from sending a really vicious, racially or sexually\\nharrassing message, and I am very concerned that I could get in\\ntrouble for that.\\n\\nWhat I\\'ve generally done is to delete the log files every few\\ndays, usually after a quick perusal to see if there are any\\nmessages which the recipient might object to.  Sometimes if I see\\na message which is of an illegal format so that it didn\\'t get sent,\\n(like forgetting the \":\" in \"Request-Remailing-To:\") I\\'ll send a\\nmessage to the sender telling him what he did wrong.\\n\\nI feel that people who run remailers should set their own policies\\nas far as the confidentiality of the messages they forward.  Running\\na remailer can be somewhat risky in the current climate and the\\noperators can legitimately seek whatever level of protection they\\nare comfortable with.  However, I think it would be good if the users\\nof the remailers could get some information about what the privacy\\npolicies are.  Maybe some remailers will simply not keep logs; maybe\\nothers will keep logs but not look at them unless a specific circumstance\\narises, and so on.  Eric Hollander has been creating a list of remailers;\\nperhaps he could solicit this kind of information from the operators\\nand publish it along with the remailer addresses and keys.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n\\nDistribution:\\n  CYPHERPUNKS >INTERNET:CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Eli Brandt <ebrandt@jarthur.Claremont.EDU>\\nDate: Mon, 14 Dec 92 13:18:36 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: Remailers.\\nIn-Reply-To: <921214165323_74076.1041_DHJ77-1@CompuServe.COM>\\nMessage-ID: <9212142118.AA03045@toad.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n> Eric Hollander has been creating a list of remailers;\\n> perhaps he could solicit this kind of information from the operators\\n> and publish it along with the remailer addresses and keys.\\n\\n(Hey, everybody send your remailer information in!)\\n\\nI have been deleting the logs every so often, unread since I debugged\\nthe remailer.

The specific purpose of TEMPESTing a computer that handles\\nclassified information is to contain any incidental information-\\nbearing electromagnetic emissions so they cannot be received at a\\ndistance. But shielding is not only a security issue, it is also\\nhighly desirable to minimize interference to users of the radio\\nspectrum (e.g., broadcast TV sets and radios).\\n\\nNow the FCC Part 15 rules (which govern \"incidental radiation devices\"\\nsuch as computers) are much less stringent than TEMPEST, but this is\\nonly an economic tradeoff because full TEMPEST-level shielding of a\\ncomputer can be very expensive. In fact, many classified shops have\\ninstead built \"screen rooms\" (or entire screened buildings, such as\\nthose at the NSA) so they can use standard commercial-grade computer\\nhardware. Anyone is free to add as much shielding to their computer\\nequipment or their entire buildings as they want.  There\\'s absolutely\\nnothing illegal about it; in fact it\\'s highly commendable to do so.\\nThe FCC (and your neighbors) will thank you for it.\\n\\nNow if you wanted to \"mask\" your computer\\'s RF emanations with some\\nsort of RF noise source (such as a Tesla coil) that\\'s another story.\\nMost transmitters require licenses for the obvious reason that they\\ncan interfere with other users of the radio spectrum. But this has\\nnothing to do with your right (or even duty) to shield your computers.\\n\\nUnfortunately the TEMPEST rules themselves are classified, so we\\nreally don\\'t know how much shielding is necessary, or what one can\\npick up from an unshielded system, or exactly how you\\'d do it.\\nObviously this is an attempt to protect NSA\\'s own SIGINT methods. But\\nthere is, to coin a phrase, \"equal protection under the laws of\\nphysics\".  Star Warriors\\' claims notwithstanding, they\\'re the same\\nfor everyone, black (classified) or white, and they\\'re open for\\nall to discover and apply on their own.\\n\\nPhil\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: treason@gnu.ai.mit.edu\\nDate: Wed, 16 Dec 92 08:46:30 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: remailers\\nMessage-ID: <9212161646.AA18468@spiff.gnu.ai.mit.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know if this message got through, but I\\'ll repost  it just in case...\\n\\nWhat I would like is a list of remailers with maybe a description of the\\nfucntions(non-standard mail) like pgp abilities or whatever.

Further,\\n          the correct levels are specified by the NSA and there  is no\\n          assurance that, while these levels are sufficient to prevent\\n          eavesdropping by unfriendly operatives,  equipment certified\\n          under NACSIM  5100A will have  levels low enough  to prevent\\n          eavesdropping by the NSA itself.\\n               The  accessibility  of  supposedly  correct  emanations\\n          levels  does  not solve  the  problem of  preventing TEMPEST\\n          eavesdropping.     Access   to  NACSIM   5100A   limits  the\\n          manufacturer to selling the equipment  only to United States\\n          governmental  agencies  with  the  need  to  process  secret\\n          information.[33]  Without  the right to possess  TEMPEST ELINT\\n          equipment  manufacturers  who  wish to  sell  to  the public\\n          sector cannot determine what a  safe level of emanations is.\\n          Further  those  manufacturers with  access  to  NACSIM 5100A\\n          should  want  to  verify that  the  levels  set  out in  the\\n          document are, in  fact, low enough to  prevent interception.\\n          Without an actual  eavesdropping device with which  to test,\\n          no   manufacturer  will   be   able  to   produce  genuinely\\n          uncompromising equipment.\\n\\nPERRY, now I put up, now YOU SHUT UP!\\n\\nsheesh.\\n\\ntreason@gnu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Richard Childers <rchilder@us.oracle.com>\\nDate: Thu, 17 Dec 92 12:45:34 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: New number for Secure Systems & Services\\nMessage-ID: <9212172044.AA04823@rchilder.us.oracle.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n\\n> and they give free samples ;-))\\n\\n\"Great.

Read it carefully, and I suggest you also read the\\n   posted document in full as well.  \\n\\nWe have read it carefully.  What your article claims is that NACSIM\\n5100A is classified, so if something is built to be TEMPEST certified,\\nthe design is classified, and the actual device can not be sold to the\\npublic, in order to prevent reverse-engineering of the standard.\\n\\nThis, however, does not mean that emf shielding is illegal.  How to do\\nemf shielding is relatively well understood --- what is classified is\\nhow much shielding is enough.  As your article itself admits, having the\\nthe NACSIM standard isn\\'t very useful anyway, since we can\\'t trust the\\nlevels promulgated by the NSA to be sufficient to prevent them from\\nlistening in.  (What you\\'re saying would be like saying that the NSA has\\na classified recommendation that RSA keys be at least XXX bits long ---\\njust because the recommendation is classified doesn\\'t mean that we can\\'t\\nuse RSA, and if the number of bits were something like 512 bits, if we\\nfound out what it was, we\\'d probably want to use something bigger\\nanyway.  :-)\\n\\nAs many other people have pointed out, emf shielding can\\'t be illegal,\\nsince it\\'s required for FCC requirements.  If someone wants to spend\\nadditional money, and put a lot more shielding that what\\'s really\\nneeded, there shouldn\\'t be any problem with that.\\n\\nFinally, I\\'m not sure about the complete accuracy of that article you\\'ve\\nposted.  We have one of the first BBN Safekeeper (tm) boxes at MIT,\\nwhich is a certificate meter which generates X.509 public key\\ncertificates for use in the Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM) system.  It *IS*\\nTEMPEST shielded(*) and BBN is planning on selling it to commercial\\ncompanies, TEMPEST shielding and all.

This is the approach discussed in the last several days\\nhere.\\n\\nShielding a room is common is certain applications, such as at NSA\\n(where the entire windowless building is so shielded), in component\\ntesting labs, and so on. Such rooms are called Faraday cages.\\n\\nIt so happens that in 1972 I worked inside such a Faraday cage (in the\\nlabs at UCSB of then-young Paul Hansma, now famous in the nanotech\\ncommunity for his AFM imaging of cells and other biological\\nmaterials). The shield consisted of copper screen mesh\\n(fine-pitch...perhaps .5 mm gaps) mounted on a wooden frame, with 2\\nlayers and an air gap between them. \\n\\nAttenuation depends on frequency, of course, and a wire mesh screen\\nlets through some frequencies (light, for example!). How many dbs of\\nattenuation at \"frequencies of interest\" depends on a lot of factors.\\nExtremely high frequency signals, becoming more common in computers as\\nprocessor speeds exceed 50 MHz, are very hard to shield, due to the\\nshort wavelengths.\\n\\nI suspect if the boys in the antenna-equipped vans are parked outside\\nyour home, nearly any leakage is too much. But there are cheaper ways\\nfor your secrets to be learned. In other words, there are more\\npressing concerns.\\n\\nI would estimate that shielding an entire room would be expensive,\\nperhaps costing $5K or more ot do a good job. Building a smaller\\nroom-within-a-room might cost a little less.\\n\\nListening to a radio is one very crude way of monitoring your own\\nRF emissions, if you don\\'t have access to specialized gear.\\n\\nUsing a laptop helps. (I have an old GRiD Compass, with plasma\\ndisplay, bubble memory, and a black magnesium case...it is definitely\\nless RF-noisy than my PowerBook, and a lot less noisy than my IIci.)\\n\\n(Perhaps Phil Karn can comment on strategies)\\n\\nBTW, we\\'ve talked about setting up our own \"van Eyck radiation\"\\nsystems to see just how easy it is to monitor computers. There is a\\nlegend, possibly urban, that the NSA did indeed try to block\\npublication of papers on the \"van Eyck\" effect. This fits part of what\\n\"Treason\" was saying, though not all of it. (And there is no law\\nsaying you can\\'t try to shield your computers, or speak in a low\\nvoice, for that matter.)\\n\\n--Tim\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

It is now quite primitive, and useful\\nonly as a proof of concept.  It does not yet do any key management, I\\njust copied the binaries of several unix utilities to be used as one\\ntime pads.  The reservation system does not work yet.  If there is a \\nmessage to be sent, it is sent immediately.  That means only one\\nof the participants can send a message in one round.  The messages\\nare not forwarded anywhere, they are just dropped to \"outgoing\" \\ndirectory.  \\n\\nIt runs on one machine, under three accounts I created just for that \\npurpose.  The mail keeps going back and forth constantly between the\\nthree accounts, with null files being deposited to the outgoing\\ndirectories.  \\n\\nTemporary files are being created and deleted.\\n\\nAs soon as I put a file in one of the incoming directories, within one\\nround it appears in each of the outgoing directories.\\n\\nSo the main function works.\\n\\nIt is written in perl, because of the ease I can manipulate binary data\\nof any size.\\n\\nAs soon as I add the minimal necessary features (PGP based key exchange,\\nand reservation blocks) I will be looking for some people to participate\\nin an experimental dc-net.  People who want to participate in this, should\\nhave fast, reliable, e-mail connections (preferably round-trip time\\nto any other participant should be less than 10 minutes).  If even one\\nparticipant has a slow link, it will hold everyone up.  You also need\\nthe ability to pipe incoming mail with a certain subject header through\\nan arbitrary program.  You can use any of the various \\'slocal\\' programs,\\nor you could use elm\\'s filter program, or any other means.  You also need\\nto have perl working on your system.  You need PGP.  \\n\\nAs someone suggested, an arbitrary group of people might not have much\\nto talk about amongst themselves, so the next feature will be forwarding\\nto a mailing address (or list), a newsgroup, or another dc-net.  It is\\nvery simple to do the forwarding, it is a little more complicated,\\nand interesting, to decide who will do the forwarding.  I would not\\nwant to rely on any single site serving as a gateway, since that\\nwould introduce a single point of compromise.  I would rather have\\nsome dynamic system, similar to the reservation blocks, that would\\nlet the net randomly decide who will forward a particular message.\\n\\nAs soon as this first test network has run for a couple of days, and all\\nthe bugs are fixed, I will release the code, so that anybody can work\\non it.  I expect that some people will work on various projects I mentioned\\nin the \"FUTURE ENCHANCEMENTS\" section of my initial posting on this\\ntopic.  I hope that people who add features to the system send the mods\\nback to me, so I can incorporate them in a new version.\\n\\nWhen there is a number of networks running, it will be interesting to\\nexperiment with hierarchical nets, or linked networks of networks.  \\n\\n\\n--\\nYanek Martinson    mthvax.cs.miami.edu!safe0!yanek     uunet!medexam!yanek\\nthis address preferred -->> yanek@novavax.nova.edu <<-- this address preferred\\nPhone (305) 765-6300 daytime   FAX: (305) 765-6708  1321 N 65 Way/Hollywood\\n      (305) 963-1931 evenings       (305) 981-9812  Florida, 33024-5819\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: tribble@xanadu.com (E.

It optionally uses kerberos\\nauthentication, and the recipient application will display whether a\\nmessage is authenticated or unauthenticated. People tended to ignore\\nthis, until one of the other developers wrote a program that looked at\\nthe database of current users, picked a pair at random, picked a\\nmessage at random, and sent it to one, from the other. (It backfired\\namusingly once -- it sent a message from him, to me, saying \"I\\'m\\nstopping at the coffeehouse, want me to get you anything?\" to which I\\nresponded sure... and then harassed him about it for years, until he\\nfinally *did* bring me the M&M\\'s I wanted. :-)\\n\\tThe point was that this program didn\\'t fake the authentication\\n(it did use privileged access to look at the user database, which is\\nnot available remotely, but the messages themselves were\\nunauthenticated) but rather noone paid attention to it. The\\n\"unauthenticated\" flag was made more visible in a later release, I\\nbelieve... but I don\\'t think anyone ever went as far as refusing\\nunauthenticated personal messages altogether.

Think\\nin terms of sound first, as it\\'s easier. A given sound represents a\\n\"1\", and another tone is \"0\". You waver back and forth between the\\ntones to describe the data you\\'re transmitting. \\n\\nThe idea is that some of the normal emission characteristics from\\ncomponents in computers (like UARTs) correspond to this sort of\\nmodulation. \\n\\nWith regard to machine types, if it\\'s a serial line, it\\'s fairly easy\\nto map the communications into a set of probably protocol suites. If\\nyou know *anything* about the use of the machine, it becomes a lot\\neasier.

It might\\nbe fairly specific, like \"so-and-so paid a debt of $50 to me within\\nthe agreed-upon two-week period.\"  Or it could be more general, like\\n\"so-and-so is, in my opinion, an honest person.\"\\n\\nI was thinking of positive reputations that might be relevant to the\\nproblem mentioned of anonymous posting to mailing lists and newsgroups.\\nAs Dean mentions, we can envision a system which uses the opposite of\\nkill files. Instead, messages would only be displayed from people who\\nmet certain criteria in terms of their reputation credentials.\\n\\nWhat would I want to see in the way of such credentials that would help\\nme decide whether I wanted to read the message?  (The issue of judging\\nthe validity of credentials is discussed below.)  Maybe recommendations\\nin favor of the poster\\'s intelligence, knowledge, judgment, temperance\\n(i.e. reluctance to flame), etc. would be useful.  Imagine a system in\\nwhich a person was rated from 1 to 10 in each of these categories.  A person\\'s\\npositive reputation would consist of (digitally) signed statements from\\nvarious \"endorsers\" (or \"introducers\"), each giving their numeric judgements\\nabout the person in question.\\n\\nWith this system, I could set my ideal mail/news reader to only display\\npostings from people whose scores met some standards.  Maybe I would\\naverage them; maybe I would weight the different categories according\\nto my own tastes.  But this would let me filter out time-wasters like\\nthe random poster who was causing problems.\\n\\nNow, this still leaves open the problem of judging the validity of\\nvarious credentials.  This problem is very similar to the problem of\\naccepting key signatures in PGP.  If I receive a PGP key loaded with\\nsignatures, that doesn\\'t mean much unless I know at least one of the\\npeople involved (either directly, or through the net).  Only then can\\nI judge how valid the signatures are.\\n\\nIn the same way, if a new person posts on a newsgroup, and includes his\\ncredential loaded with 10/10/10/10\\'s, that doesn\\'t mean anything unless\\nI know some of these people who are vouching for him.  In the most\\nextreme case, he could have created a bunch of false identities and had\\nthem provide all the endorsements.  So an endorser unknown to me is\\nnot useful.\\n\\nIt\\'s interesting that the PGP key \"web of trust\" may have application\\nto this more general problem.  I wonder if the PEM folks will push for\\na centralized \"email posting quality\" hierarchy in which agencies rate\\neach person\\'s quality of postings and assign them an official score. :-)\\nThis would be the analog of their solution to the key-signature problem.\\n\\nThat\\'s about as far as I\\'ve gotten.  A few more general comments:\\nSuch a system requires an infrastructure of public-key encryption and\\ndigital signatures.  Only in that way will signed credentials be secure\\nenough to be meaningful.  Since so few people use these tools today,\\na positive-credential system would filter out almost everyone, throwing\\nout the baby with the bath water.\\n\\nBut, remailers are springing up everywhere.  It is an idea whose time\\nhas come, it seems.  So the problem exists today, but the solution can\\'t\\nbe practically applied for at least another year or two, even assuming\\nrapid acceptance of PGP, RIPEM, PEM, or some other cryptographic standard.\\nThat means that there may be some political pressure against remailers\\nduring this interval.  Perhaps we can turn this to our advantage by describing\\nthe advantages of a credential system, and using that to further encourage\\nwidespread use of cryptographic programs.\\n\\nHal Finney\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\niQCVAgUBKzFI+KgTA69YIUw3AQEdCQP8DbPD9jrlR1MhlLOOQrSUc8Svcue2DZsj\\n+DIXiC50bpv+C5pZYtoCa5SuOXX8W6XmZRSkZW3gilvEKDQ2Zt7hH0ol+tFnn8cs\\nq05T1bYJIZqdMdqia6PZkVyvs+DQLuQSog5rZxAja1XfC/Rq59RnbPp2IViLqDiD\\nOfiasXA4Egs=\\n=GVH7\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n\\nDistribution:\\n  CYPHERPUNKS >INTERNET:CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Marc Horowitz <marc@Athena.MIT.EDU>\\nDate: Fri, 18 Dec 92 01:08:33 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: holiday travel:  sign some keys!\\nMessage-ID: <9212180907.AA07411@portnoy.MIT.EDU>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nWith the holidays coming up, and many of us traveling to see friends\\nand relatives, we all have a great chance to sign keys of people who\\naren\\'t in our normal circle of contact.

Such lists have little reason\\nto fear people hiding behind cloaks of anonymity.

New instances of all of these pop up and succeed all\\nthe time.\\n\\nNegative reputation systems work very poorly.  Right now I receive\\ncypherpunks.  I used to receive Extropians (and will do so again\\nsoon).  The volume can get horrific at times.  Consider all the stuff\\nthat I\\'m not receiving (that I filtered out).  I don\\'t see\\nsci.nanotech, sci.crypt, alt.pgp (?), libernet, alt.politics,\\nalt.sex.bondage, etc. because I haven\\'t the bandwidth.\\n\\nAh, but if I could pick and choose among the entire available feed\\nrather than ignoring most of it just so I have a hope of filtering\\ndown to a manageable mail load....\\n\\nThat\\'s what positive filters are for.  There are lots of gems buried\\nin the crap of net-news (and remember that my gems may be your crap),\\nand I want a system that will find them for me.\\n\\nI think the approach of reputation filtered mailing lists is a bad\\none.  That reputation filtering process is simply a poor mechanism to\\navail us all of the moderator\\'s taste in email.  If we had a better\\nmechanism, then such a list is just alt.extropy or sci.crypt where\\nthings are prioritized (using the positive prioritixing information of\\nsuch people who would otherwise be moderators) such that I see the\\ngood stuff and ignore the bozoz (whomever they are).  Or in the more\\nlikely case, I just see the creme de la creme of the good stuff\\nbecause that\\'s all I have time for.\\n\\nIn such a system, one can think of a magazine as simply purchasing the\\neditor\\'s priority information.\\n\\nPaul Baclace built a genetic algorithm thing that would present\\nnetnews from all groups in prioritized order.  As you gave it feedback\\non how glad you were to receive each message, it didi pattern matching\\non features of the messages to make better sorters.  This ends up\\ncorrelating author (anonymous or otherwise), subjet, topic, reply\\nchain, time of day, whatever seems relevant into the prioritization of\\nmail.  If those weight could be spread, combined with manually entered\\nfilters (\"I\\'m tired of politics...\"), etc. you might actually be able\\nto spend less time on email/news getting more value from it.\\n\\ndean\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: 2FTPHAVOC@kuhub.cc.ukans.edu\\nDate: Fri, 18 Dec 92 15:24:06 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Patently false rumor\\nMessage-ID: <01GSGW2OK9420056TH@KUHUB.CC.UKANS.EDU>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nI just finished reading the Mondo 2k article on cypherpunks.

Pax could be the first remailer in the chain,\\nstripping the sig.  The message could then go through our remailers,\\nproviding non-traced security, at least if you can find someone who\\ndoes not keep logs.\\n\\nAnonymous posting can be done already.  Anyone can post to most newsgroups\\nby sending mail to certain addresses.  One such system is at Berkeley.\\nSend to, e.g., sci-crypt@ucbvax.berkeley.edu to post to sci.crypt.  There\\nis another such system running in Austin, TX, I believe, but I don\\'t\\nhave the corresponding net address handy.  So this capability is already\\nprovided by our (or anyone\\'s) remailers.\\n\\nOne reason I haven\\'t looked at stripping the .sig is due to an email\\ndiscussion I had about a month ago with Eric Hughes.  Eric strongly\\nfelt that message bodies should be preserved as much as possible by the\\nremailers, in accordance with the general principle of Internet mail\\nforwarding.  Too much mangling is done already by mail gateways,\\nand adding more changes might be harmful.  Obviously, the remailers can\\'t\\navoid doing some processing of the message body, what with the \"::\"\\npasting tokens and PGP decryption, but Eric felt that unnecessary\\nchanges should be minimized.

Perhaps a\\nColumbia Law professor\\'s views on these questions may be helpful.   \\nI\\'m going to discuss the realities of the situation, without jargon,\\nrather than the legal technicalities.  Those who want to discuss the\\nlegal detail should feel free to contact me, but for legal advice I\\nusually get paid.\\n\\nPKP says that any user of PGP is \"inducing\" infringement.  Here\\'s the\\nreality of the situation.  PKP is the licensee of a presumptively\\nvalid US patent, which it claims PGP 2.1 infringes.  If the patent is\\nvalid, and PGP infringes, every user is not just inducing\\ninfringement--he/she/it is infringing the patent.  This is not a\\ncrime; it\\'s a civil wrong, for which, as the PKP statement says,\\ndamages are available at law.  But this is true every time a\\nmanufacturer sells or distributes an infringing article.  As you may\\nrecall, for example, an inventor recently won an enormous damages\\njudgment against a major US auto company for infringing his patent  \\nfor intermittent windshield wipers.  Theoretically, under the patent  \\nlaw, he could instead have notified all Ford buyers in the past  \\ndecade that they were personally infringing his patent.  But it is  \\ngrossly impracticable to do that, and a suit against the manufacturer\\naccomplishes exactly the same result, since the total amount of the\\ndamages available is the same either way, while the litigation cost  \\nis not.  PKP can test the validity of its patent and recover its  \\ndamages, if any, in a suit against the developers and distributors of  \\nPGP, if it cares to.  Without any knowledge of their thinking, I  \\npredict the partners won\\'t want to do that.  It would be expensive,  \\nthe damages to be recovered would be slight or none, and they would  \\nrisk having the only patent anywhere in the world protecting their  \\ntechnology declared invalid.  But in any event, it is virtually  \\nunheard-of to sue individual end-use consumers of allegedly  \\ninfringing technology.  If PKP\\'s investors had $100 million or so  \\nthey wanted to waste in litigation anything could happen, but they  \\ndon\\'t, and it won\\'t.\\n\\nIn any event, in such a situation a lawyer certainly might advise her\\nclient to wait for the patent-holder to assert his rights directly. \\n\\nWhen PKP sends you a personal letter claiming that you are infringing\\nits patent, and asking you to take out a license, you can decide what\\nyou want to do about it.  In the meanwhile, the patent claim against\\nend users is mostly, probably entirely, just noise.\\n\\nThe Munitions Act bluster contained in the post is not even that\\nimportant.  It\\'s just ridiculous.  Others have said some of the most\\nimportant things well, so I\\'ll be brief.  First, even if PKP believes\\nits own arguments interpreting the ITARs, PKP doesn\\'t have squat to  \\ndo with ITAR enforcement.  This is a question addressed to the  \\ndiscretion of the Treasury, the Department of Justice, and local  \\nUnited States Attorneys.  ITAR enforcement against distributors of  \\nPGP would require a decision by all those agencies that the  \\nhighest-priority Munitions Act enforcement problem at some future  \\nmoment is the prohibition of IMPORTATION of a CONSUMER SOFTWARE  \\nPRODUCT embodying TECHNICAL INFORMATION IN THE PUBLIC DOMAIN.  I  \\nchallenge PKP, or anyone else, to show any past example of such an  \\napproach to ITAR enforcement by any Administration.  I cannot myself  \\nimagine any United States Attorney\\'s office wanting to bring such a  \\ncase, which is of nightmarish complexity, would be politically  \\nunpopular, and does nothing whatever to stem the global arms trade or  \\nincrease the national security of the US.  I very much doubt that PKP  \\nreally believes that the domestic circulation of PGP violates the  \\nITARs, since PKP itself terms as \"unfortunate\" the application of the  \\nMunitions Act to cryptographic technology.  But even if that\\'s really  \\nwhat PKP or its officers think, so what?  The chances that the United  \\nStates Government will ever agree, and put weight behind agreement,  \\nare within fuzz of zero.\\n\\nUseNet serves many social purposes.  One, apparently, is the no-cost\\ndistribution of negative advertising and legal chest-pounding,\\nintended to frighten people away from experimentation with a piece of\\ninteresting freeware.  Myself, I would just put the PKP temper  \\ntantrum in the bitbucket.  But since other people have taken it  \\nseriously (much more seriously than it deserves) I thought a few more  \\nsober comments might be warranted.\\n_____________________________________________________________________\\nFiat Justitia,         \"Quoi que vous fassiez, ecrasez l\\'infame,\\nruat Coelum.                           et aimez qui vous aime.\"\\nEben Moglen                       voice: 212-854-8382\\nProfessor of Law & Legal History    fax: 212-854-7946          \\nColumbia Law School, 435 West 116th Street, NYC 10027           \\nmoglen@lawmail.columbia.edu\\n-- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: wcs@anchor.ho.att.com (Bill Stewart)\\nDate: Mon, 21 Dec 92 08:11:21 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: Re: Destroying Data (Re: Remailer Policies)\\nMessage-ID: <9212211610.AA21587@anchor.ho.att.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text\\n\\n\\nYanek points out that \"rm\" doesn\\'t destroy data on disks, just inodes,\\nand that you have to overwrite the data to destroy it.

Why?  Well, several well-known servers have\\n> bitten the dust recently. And most of them have served only a very limited\\n> subset of newsgroups, and mail only to \"registered\", anonymous users. One\\n> quite successful attempt at solving this problem was the server running at\\n> godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu, written and operated by Karl Kleinpaste\\n> <Karl_Kleinpaste@cs.cmu.edu>. Karl\\'s software has been posted to alt.sources.\\n> \\n> Due to reasons too complicated to mention here I wanted to set up an\\n> anonymous server for the scandinavian user community. I contacted Karl, and\\n> got a pre-release copy of his software. As the version I got relied heavily\\n> on the advanced features of MMDFII, I had to modify it quite a bit. While\\n> hacking around, I removed the restriction of only supporting selected\\n> newsgroups. Within a week of startup, the server had been discovered by\\n> transatlantic users, and more recent stats show european users are definitely\\n> a minority.\\n> \\n> So what does the anon server really do? Well, it provides a front for\\n> sending mail messages and posting news items anonymously. As you send your\\n> very first message to the server, it automatically allocates you an id of\\n> the form anNNN, and sends you a message containing the allocated id. This id\\n> is used in all your subsequent anon posts/mails. Any mail messages sent to\\n> your-id@anon.penet.fi gets redirected to your original, real address. Any\\n> reply is of course anonymized in the same way, so the server provides a\\n> double-blind. You will not know the true identity of any user, unless she\\n> chooses to reveal her identity explicitly.\\n> \\n> In the anonymization process all headers indicating the true originator are\\n> removed, and an attempt is made to remove any automatically-included\\n> signatures, by looking for a line starting with two dashes (--), and zapping\\n> everything from there on. But if your signature starts with anything else,\\n> it\\'s your own responsibility to remove it from your messages.\\n> \\n> There are two basic ways to use the system. The easiest way is by sending a\\n> message to recipient@anon.penet.fi:\\n> \\n> \\tTo: alt.sex.bestiality@anon.penet.fi\\n> \\n> \\tTo: an9999@anon.penet.fi\\n> \\n> \\tTo: help@anon.penet.fi\\n> \\n> Of course, in the case of mailing to a known user, you have to use addresses of\\n> the form user%host.domain@anon.penet.fi, or the pretty obscure source addressing\\n> construct of @anon.penet.fi:user@host.domain. These constructs are not\\n> necessarily handled properly by all mail systems, so I strongly recommend the\\n> \"X-Anon-To:\" approach in these cases. This works by you sending a message to\\n> \"anon@anon.penet.fi\", including a X-Anon-To: header line containing the desired\\n> recipient. But this really has to be a field in the message header, before the\\n> first empty line in the message. So:\\n> \\n> \\tTo: anon@anon.penet.fi\\n> \\tX-Anon-To: alt.sex.needlework,rec.masturbation\\n> \\n> \\tTo: anon@anon.penet.fi\\n> \\tX-Anon-To: jack@host.bar.edu\\n> \\n> Valid recipients in both cases are fully qualified user addresses in RFC-822\\n> format (user@host.domain), anon user id\\'s (anNNN), newsgroup names\\n> (alt.sex.paperclips) or one of the \"special\" user names of ping, nick, help,\\n> admin and stat.\\n> \\n> Sending to \"ping\" causes a short reply to be sent confirming (and\\n> allocating, if needed) your anon id. \"nick\" takes the contents of the\\n> Subject: header and installs it as your nickname. If you have a nickname, it\\n> appears in the From: header in the anonymized message along with your anon\\n> id. \"help\" returns this text, and stat gives some statistics about the\\n> system.

Steacie Memorial Fellowship\\n(Canada\\'s Nserc).\\n\\n1  Introduction\\n\\nAn outstanding book on cryptology has hit the market this year.\\nAlthough the news may be stale to many of my readers, Gustavus J.\\nSimmons has edited a 640-page mammoth of a masterpiece titled\\nContemporary Cryptology: The Science of Information Integrity,\\npublished by IEEE Press.  In addition, other new and exciting books\\nare expected to come out soon.\\n\\n2  Simmons\\' Book\\n\\nSimmons\\' Contemporary Cryptology grew out of a special issue of the\\nProceedings of the IEEE, which he edited in May 1988.  I remember how\\nproud -- and rightly so! -- Simmons was concerning that issue: his\\nfavourite line was that ``this is an example where the whole is better\\nthan the sum of its parts\\'\\'.  As a consequence of the excellent\\nreception of his special issue, he was commissioned by the IEEE to edit\\nthe book we are now discussing.  Speaking of excellent reception, the\\nfirst printing of Simmons\\' book was sold out in months.  The second\\nprinting, which I have not seen yet, corrected all mistakes that had\\nbeen found in the first.  In addition, reference citations for\\npublications that had appeared after the first printing went to press\\nwere completed, and a number of footnotes, notes added in proof and\\ninserted paragraphs to update significant statements of fact that had\\noccurred in the interim were made.\\n\\nIt is amusing to note that the book\\'s cover is very similar to that of\\nthe Proceedings, except that Simmons corrected an embarrassing mistake\\nthat I pointed out to him on the Proceedings cover (see if you can spot\\nit!).  The book is hard cover, pleasant to manipulate, and handsome.\\nUnfortunately, I found the binding of my own copy to be slightly\\ndefective, but I was told that this problem was corrected with the\\nsecond printing.\\n\\nContemporary Cryptology is a collection of chapters, many of which\\nwritten by top researchers in the field, which together span most of\\nthe exciting developments that have changed cryptology forever in the\\npast twenty years.  Simmons himself contributed the foreword and three\\nchapters.  His master plan -- the table of contents -- is well\\nconceived as few important topics have been left out.  (Nothing is\\nperfect, though ... the book is lacking a chapter on quantum\\ncryptography!) Unfortunately, even a good coach cannot enforce perfect\\ncoordination concerning who says what in a multi-author work.  This\\nbook is no exception: it suffers from many repetitions of the same\\nconcepts across chapters.\\n\\nThe main sections of the book are Cryptography, Authentication,\\nProtocols, Cryptanalysis, and Applications.  This is preceded by two\\nessays on the theme ``Contemporary Cryptology\\'\\': a foreword by Simmons\\nand an introduction by James L. Massey.  Massey\\'s introduction to\\ncryptology is among the clearest and most useful I have ever seen that\\ncan fit on as few as 36 pages (although another particularly noteworthy\\nconcise introduction is Simmons\\' own entry in the Encyclopaedia\\nBritannica).  Massey\\'s introduction covers some history, motivations,\\nall the basic notation, secret key cryptography (both in theory and in\\npractice, including a review of Shannon\\'s information theory, the DES,\\nstream ciphers and Ueli Maurer\\'s recent bid to get around Shannon\\'s\\ndiscouraging theorem that the one-time-pad is the most economical\\nsystem that can provide perfect secrecy), authentication (a section\\nthat I found particularly useful last time I taught on the subject),\\npublic key cryptography (including one-way functions, public key\\ndistribution, RSA and variations on the theme), and protocols.  Massey\\neven includes an enlightening discussion of secret versus open research\\nin cryptology.  One thing I learned from Massey\\'s introduction is that\\nthe notion of one-wayness goes back to at least 1873!  On the negative\\nside, nothing is said about probabilistic encryption and zero-knowledge\\nprotocols, and digital signatures are not covered adequately.  But\\nthen, Massey makes an explicit point that it was not his purpose to\\nsurvey research in cryptology.  Moreover, these topics are treated in\\nother chapters of Simmons\\' book.\\n\\nAfter the foreword and introduction, the first section deals with\\ncryptography.  The topics covered are ``The DES: Past and Future\\'\\' by\\nMiles E.  Smid and Dennis K. Branstad, ``Stream Ciphers\\'\\' by Rainer A.\\nRueppel, ``The First Ten Years of Public Key Cryptography\\'\\' by\\nWhitfield Diffie, ``Public Key Cryptography\\'\\' by James Nechvatal, and\\n``A Comparison of Practical Public Key Cryptosystems Based on Integer\\nFactorization and Discrete Logarithms\\'\\' by Paul C. van Oorschot.  The\\nchapter on DES goes from the birth of the system to predictions\\nconcerning the coming decade, not forgetting to cover the controversy\\nsurrounding it and its many applications.  New, post-DES algorithms are\\nalso discussed.  However, the coverage of attacks against DES is far\\nfrom complete; in particular, differential cryptanalysis is not even\\nmentioned.\\n\\nRueppel is a leading expert in stream ciphers, and the author of a\\nwell-known book on the topic; he was therefore the natural choice of\\nauthor for Simmon\\'s second chapter.  After introducing all the relevant\\nbackground, Rueppel covers information-theoretic, system-theoretic and\\ncomplexity-theoretic approaches to stream ciphers.  A large number of\\npseudo-random generators are described.  The chapter also considers\\nrandomized stream ciphers, which can provide practical provable\\nsecurity in the presence of a large,  publicly accessible, body of\\nrandomness.\\n\\nDiffie\\'s chapter on the history of public key cryptography is a pure\\ngem, which could only have been told so well by the horse\\'s mouth.  In\\nmy opinion, Simmons\\' book would be worth buying even if only for those\\n39 pages.  Of particular interest is the story of how Ralph Merkle,\\nthen at Berkeley, invented as early as 1974 the concept of public key\\ndistribution, and how unsuccessful he was in explaining and publishing\\nhis idea.  (Merkle told me that Bob Fabry, contrary to many others, had\\nunderstood the idea and had encouraged him to seek fame and fortune\\nwith it!) Diffie goes on explaining the principles of public key\\ncryptography and the early solutions, including RSA.  An interesting\\nsection on key management, the main aspect that was sorely missing from\\nthe early papers on public-key cryptography, is provided.  Diffie\\'s\\nchapter continues with applications, such as the secure phone system,\\nand implementations.  Finally, Diffie goes beyond what his title\\npromised, as he tackles new directions for public key cryptography.\\n\\nThe next chapter, by Nechvatal, is by far the longest in this book (120\\npages).  It was written as a stand alone piece, which is unfortunate in\\nthis context as it presents significant overlap with other chapters of\\nthe book.  In my opinion, the author would have been better advised to\\ntransform his writing into a monograph of its own.  Nevertheless, this\\nchapter is well written and contains a wealth of valuable information.\\n\\nIn the last chapter of the first section, van Oorschot reviews the\\ncurrently best algorithms for extracting discrete logarithms (both in\\nGF(2^n) and in elliptic curves) and for factoring, including a detailed\\nanalysis of their efficiency.  This is used as the basis of a\\ncomparison between El Gamal\\'s cryptosystem and RSA.  Elliptic curve\\ncryptosystems are also considered.\\n\\nSection 2 deals with authentication.  It is composed of one chapter on\\n``Digital Signatures\\'\\' by Chris J. Mitchell, Fred Piper and Peter Wild,\\nand ``A Survey of Information Authentication\\'\\' by Simmons.  The chapter\\non digital signatures provides thorough coverage of the theory,\\npractice and applications of signatures, including a section on\\nhashing.  Nonetheless, it is sad that David Chaum\\'s elegant notion of\\nUndeniable Signature did not find its way in that chapter even though\\nit was published as early as 1989.  The next chapter was written by the\\nman I consider to be no less than ``the Shannon of authentication\\'\\',\\nthe book\\'s editor himself.  Indeed, Simmons developed in the 1980\\'s a\\ntheory of authentication that parallels that of Shannon for privacy.\\nThis chapter shows a good balance between theory and practice, which\\ncould also be said about its author.  I must admit, however, that I\\nfound Massey\\'s exposition of Simmons\\' theories in the Introduction\\neasier to follow than Simmons\\' own.  Nevertheless, I read this chapter\\nwith particular interest and enjoyment.\\n\\nThe next section deals with protocols.  It consists of an ``Overview of\\nInteractive Proof Systems and Zero-Knowledge\\'\\' by Joan Feigenbaum and\\n``An introduction to Shared Secret and/or Shared Control Schemes and\\nTheir Applications\\'\\' again by Simmons.  It must be pointed out that the\\nvery important (in my opinion) topic of multi-party computation, also\\nknown as ``post-cold war cryptography\\'\\', is missing altogether from\\nthis section on protocols and indeed from the entire book as far as I\\ncan tell.  I like Feigenbaum\\'s succinct exposition of interactive\\nproofs and zero-knowledge, even though it was written more from a\\ncomputational complexity point of view than from a cryptographic point\\nof view.  For instance, the existence of an interactive proof system\\nfor the permanent is of considerable interest in complexity theory, as\\nit lead the way to Shamir\\'s proof that IP = PSPACE (see my column in\\nVol. 21, no. 1, 1990) but I fail to see its direct cryptographic\\nsignificance.\\n\\nTurning now to the chapter on secret sharing, I can think of no one\\nbetter suited than Simmons for writing it.  After reviewing Shamir\\'s\\nand Blakley\\'s (very different) original ideas, he addresses access\\nstructures more general than simple threshold schemes.  Most of the\\nschemes explained are based upon geometric considerations.  An\\napplication to key distribution is provided.  A comprehensive\\nbibliography follows.\\n\\nThe fourth section deals with cryptography\\'s sister discipline:\\ncryptanalysis.  It consists of one chapter on ``Cryptanalysis:  A\\nSurvey of Recent Results\\'\\' by Ernest F. Brickell and Andrew M. Odlyzko,\\nand one chapter on ``Protocol Failures in Cryptosystems\\'\\' by Judy H.\\nMoore.  The chapter on cryptanalysis surveys recent cryptanalytic\\nachievements.  Particularly thorough treatment is given to the breaking\\nof the knapsack and of linear congruential generators.  Other\\ncryptosystems and signature schemes are covered.  Information is also\\nprovided on the state-of-the-art concerning the cryptanalysis of yet\\nunbroken systems such as RSA, discrete exponentiation schemes, the\\nMcEliece cryptosystem, and the DES.  Recent developments such as the\\nnumber field sieve for factoring and the differential cryptanalysis\\ntechnique are mentioned, but Biham and Shamir\\'s attack on the full\\n16-round DES was achieved only after Simmons\\' book went to press.\\n\\nMoore\\'s chapter on protocol failures addresses an interesting problem:\\nit tells you how to cheat an application centered around a cryptosystem\\nwithout in fact breaking the cryptosystem itself.  In other words, even\\ngood cryptosystems are potentially vulnerable when improperly used, or\\nwhen used according to a badly designed protocol.  Guidelines are given\\nto avoid such traps.  (Perhaps the most spectacular protocol failure in\\nhistory concerned the Enigma during World War II, but this is of course\\nnot treated in Moore\\'s chapter!)\\n\\nThe book closes with a section on applications.  It contains one\\nchapter on ``The Smart Card:  A Standardized Security Device Dedicated\\nto Public Cryptology\\'\\' by Louis C. Guillou, Michel Ugon and\\nJean-Jacques Quisquater, and a chapter on ``How to Insure That Data\\nAcquired to Verify Treaty Compliance Are Trustworthy\\'\\', once more by\\nSimmons.  The chapter on smart cards describes what a smart card is and\\nwhat it can do.  The important issue of standardization is treated at\\nlength.  Significant information is given on the technology behind\\nsmart cards.  Naturally, most of the chapter is concerned with security\\nissues and cryptographic applications, such as authentication.  The\\nbook\\'s final chapter deals with real life field work pioneered by the\\neditor at Sandia National Laboratories, which is the result of nearly\\ntwo decades of development.  I prefer to say no more so as to keep your\\nappetite whetted!\\n\\nIn conclusion, this is a remarkable book, which I very strongly\\nrecommend as necessary addition to the library of any serious\\nresearcher in the field of cryptology.\\n\\n3  Other books\\n\\nThese are exciting times for cryptoreaders.  In addition to Simmon\\'s,\\nother promising books are due to appear soon.  Even though I prefer to\\nwait until they have come out to review them in detail (despite the\\nfact that I have seen preliminary versions), I cannot resist the\\ntemptation to give you an avant gout.\\n\\nEli Biham and Adi Shamir have written up in great detail their\\ndifferential cryptanalysis technique and how it applies to the full\\n16-round DES as well as to other cryptosystems and hashing functions.\\nThis is along the lines of Volume 4, number 1 of the Journal of\\nCryptology, only more of it and better.  The preliminary title of their\\nbook is Differential Cryptanalysis of the Data Encryption Standard.  It\\nwill be published by Springer-Verlag.\\n\\nStarting from notes taken by the students of a class he taught at the\\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, Mike Luby has written\\nPseudorandomness and Applications, which will be published by Princeton\\nUniversity Press.  The book, now complete in the opinion of its author,\\nis undergoing a review process.  In it, Luby places pseudorandomness at\\nthe heart of cryptography.  He explains how to produce\\ncryptographically secure pseudorandomness and how to use it for various\\ncryptographic purposes.  As one of the researchers to whom we owe the\\nproof that one-way functions are necessary and sufficient to obtain\\ncryptographically strong pseudorandom generators, Luby was the logical\\nauthor to write this authoritative book.\\n\\nIn addition, allow me to indulge in mentioning that my own\\nSpringer-Verlag monograph Modern Cryptology:  A Tutorial is expected to\\ncome out in French this November.  It will be published by Masson under\\nthe title of Cryptologie Contemporaine.  Contrary to the previous\\ntranslation into Italian (also published by Masson), the French version\\n(translated by Claude Goutier) was fully revised and updated by the\\nauthor.  For instance, the number of references went up from 250 to 366\\n(you better tackle them on a leap year if you cannot handle more than\\none per day!).\\n\\nHave you written something lately?  If you have, I would appreciate\\nhearing about it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Hal <74076.1041@CompuServe.COM>\\nDate: Tue, 22 Dec 92 09:03:06 PST\\nTo: CYPHERPUNKS <CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM>\\nSubject: Remailers.\\nMessage-ID: <921222165319_74076.1041_DHJ39-1@CompuServe.COM>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\n\\nOne problem with the current encrypted remailers that people should\\nbe aware of is that, since they operate unattended, they have to be\\nable to decrypt messages automatically.\\n\\nThis means that when an incoming messages arrives, the remailing software\\nautomatically runs PGP on the incoming message to do the decryption.\\nBut to decrypt, PGP has to be given the pass phrase for the remailer\\'s\\nsecret key.  The only way this can be done is to have the pass phrase,\\nIN THE CLEAR, in the remailing software scripts.\\n\\nThe scripts are (or should be) protected using the Unix file system\\nso that only the owner and root can read them.  But it\\'s important to\\nknow that root has access both to the secret key ring which holds the\\nremailer\\'s key, and to the pass phrase which will activate that key.\\nThis means that, at any time, root can find out the secret key of the\\nremailer, and read all messages encrypted for that remailer.\\n\\nI don\\'t think there is any way around this problem if the remailer is\\ngoing to run unattended.  The only real solution is to operate on a\\nmachine where it doesn\\'t matter whether root knows the key; that is,\\na machine where root is the operator of the mailing list.\\n\\nHal\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\niQCVAgUBKzcZ0agTA69YIUw3AQEFhAQAlloC1eyaIuJDG91VzPoRv0MjzKlob8Te\\nC3N7XWLvszypOgKNBoEb1z8fF5ZsS20NhhRhtr7A3J4jxe88vGuea0Kvxzj4NGd4\\nbQeewhYk01ygoLzZOwv8BnN6pE7/uxk5POWq3XQuX80VQzistePfRRdNozTA09EY\\n4bBOr3s9Ig8=\\n=nJ/a\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\nMy public key, signed by PRZ:\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\nVersion: 2.0\\n\\nmQCNAiqsNkwAAAEEAMKWM52m5EWi0ocK4u1cC2PPyHT6tavk9PC3TB5XBYDegf3d\\nsldRpnjJj1r+aO08FFO+QLEI9wtBqvf1PPP5iLX7sD2uIVlJH14MPtyVtjm9ZKb8\\nJMtCW74045BgtHBC9yQ3V7vXNV5jM6dE2ocnH4AI/pBFrGLJPKgTA69YIUw3AAUR\\ntCZIYWwgRmlubmV5IDw3NDA3Ni4xMDQxQGNvbXB1c2VydmUuY29tPokAlQIFECqu\\nM1Tidd4O/2f3CwEByrUD/3uoV2y+Fuicrrd2oDawgOw9Ejcx6E+Ty9PVPqKvflLs\\n0zYyGfeFVSgBbTSDP3X91N3F68nydl9J9VA6QRCGelHM1cZRukCJ0AYbKYfpwUN0\\nxjEGHsDrd2gT5iWlB3vBZvi+6Ybs4rSq+gyZzVm1/+oRrMen32fz2r0CLgUtHok2\\n=fF6Z\\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\\n\\n\\nDistribution:\\n  CYPHERPUNKS >INTERNET:CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: Hal <74076.1041@CompuServe.COM>\\nDate: Tue, 22 Dec 92 09:02:47 PST\\nTo: CYPHERPUNKS <CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM>\\nSubject: Remailer encryption.\\nMessage-ID: <921222165347_74076.1041_DHJ39-2@CompuServe.COM>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----\\n\\nFrom: miron@extropia.wimsey.com (Miron Cuperman)\\n\\n> In any case, the current scheme for ARA\\'s is insecure.

What kind of encryption\\ninstructions would be used in the ARA?  Would they be public key or\\nsecret key?\\n\\nChaum\\'s \"Mix\" paper in CACM (1981?  I don\\'t have my refs handy) had\\na concept where at each step the remailer would encrypt the outgoing\\nnon-address part of the message with a DES key found in the anonymous\\naddress.  The user would remember all the DES keys used in the ARA\\nand un-apply them in reverse order to reconstruct the original message.\\nThis would require some special software, I\\'d think, to remember the\\nDES keys and unapply them (and to construct the anonymous address).\\n(Actually, Chaum didn\\'t specify DES but rather just an unspecified secret\\nkey system.  If PGP were used for some of this then perhaps IDEA would\\nbe a good choice.)\\n\\nThis system sounded pretty complicated, and it still had the problem\\nthat by sending multiple messages to the same address a remailer could\\ndo some simple traffic analysis and break the ARA.  E.g. it would send\\n5 messages to an ARA today, and discovers that it later gets 5 messages\\nfor user X (because it happens to be the last remailer in the ARA chain).\\nTomorrow, it sends 10 messages to that same ARA, and discovers 10 messages\\nfor that same user.  The next day it sends 7 messages to the ARA, and\\ndiscovers 7 messages for that user.  Eventually it can deduce that the\\nuser and the ARA go together.\\n\\nTo avoid this, Chaum calls these \"one-time\" ARA\\'s and recommends that\\nmixes not accept messages for the same ARA more than once.  I don\\'t\\nthink this is a practical suggestion, though, since a one-time ARA is\\nnot useful enough.\\n\\nHal Finney\\n74076.1041@compuserve.com\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\niQCVAgUBKzcdKKgTA69YIUw3AQFK9wP/a27AgcL4ppMpYIbDfBy6Vw8NTjJzKpsL\\nhQibQ3XO3wPFURS3Mn51eYLyYRuJPY1/Ve+Y1Kbb6oLiW1u8Btw8CxvB1xe05f32\\nj0JwzSN1yL8blGMh4JxxXZI0t3SViJ1COt6p+I1SYLjftte/0YX0gc6dweFNUnkZ\\n5VC4FH2WCbQ=\\n=+Jx9\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n\\nDistribution:\\n  CYPHERPUNKS >INTERNET:CYPHERPUNKS@TOAD.COM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: yanek@novavax.nova.edu (Yanek Martinson)\\nDate: Tue, 22 Dec 92 10:59:24 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: IEEE Ordering Info\\nMessage-ID: <9212221858.AA07594@novavax.nova.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nIf you want to order the book Peter posted about, call 800 678 4333,\\npress 1, then ask for Contemporary Cryptology book by Simmons.  \\n\\nIt\\'s $79.95 (+$6 s/h).

If some\\nintervening mailer has added or removed trailing blanks, then the\\nsignatures will be wrong.  Presumably something like this has happened\\nto my signed message on which Edgar found a bad signature.  Perhaps\\nEdgar could try stripping any trailing blanks from his copy of my\\nmessage and see if it then signature-checks OK.

I would\\n> appreciate either references to or on line copies of useful material. The\\n> three main things I need are a clear explanation of the technology (public\\n> key cryptography in particular),\\n\\nI assume that you just want an explanation of what the technology does, not\\nhow exactly it works, i.e. I am not going to include the formulas and\\nalgorithms, just a description of what it does and how it can be used.\\n\\nHere\\'s a summary of a couple of the most relevant technologies:\\n\\nPUBLIC KEY CRYPTOGRAPHY -- each person generates two keys, one is called\\nteh public key the other is private.  These two are related in that what is\\nencrypted with one can only be decrypted with the other.  It is impossible\\n(computationally infeasible) to derive one knowing the other.  The most\\npopular public key cryptography algorithm is RSA, which is based on the\\nease of multiplying large primes, and the difficulty of factoring the\\nproduct.\\n\\nHow it is used: you publish the public key, while keeping the private key\\nto yourself.  Anyone can send a secret message to you by encrypting it with\\nyour public key.  You are the only one that can decrypt the message, since\\nonly you have the private key.\\n\\nYou can reply by encrypting your message with their public key, and they\\ncan decrypt it with their private key.\\n\\n\\nDIGITAL SIGNATURES -- techniques that are used to verify that a message\\nclaiming to be from you was actually written by you.  To do that, you\\ncompute a \"message digest\", which is similar to a \"checksum\" in that it can\\nbe used to check that the message has not been altered.  Then you encrypt\\nthe \"digest\" with your private key and attach to the message.  Currently\\nthe most popular \"digest\" algorithm is MD5.\\n\\nTo verify a signature:  the person verifying computes the same checksum,\\nthen decrypts the checksum attached to the message.  If the two match, the\\nmessage must have been signed by you, since no-one else has your private\\nkey, and could not have generated the signature.\\n\\n\\nDIFFEY-HELLMANN KEY EXCHANGE --  a protocol by which two communicating\\nparties can arrive at a secret piece of information that can not be known\\nto a passive eavesdropper (as in a wiretap), and can not be recovered from\\nanalysis of recorded communication.  This secret piece of information is\\nusually used as the key for a conventional cryptography algorithm such as\\nDES or IDEA to encrypt following communication.  \\n\\n\\nSENDER UNTRACEABILITY -- use of a protocol by which one of a group of\\ncommnicating entities can send a public message, while it is impossible\\nto trace the message to the sender.  This can be used to send messages\\nanonymously or pseudonymously and untraceably.  One of the protocols that\\nmakes this possible is David Chaum\\'s dc-net protocol, in which every\\nparticipant sends some data, and when all the data are combined, the\\nanonymous message emerges.  Another is the mix-net, or \"remailer\" approach.\\nIn this case, you send your message to a re-mailer, with encrypted\\ninstructions on where to send it.  By sending your message through a chain\\nof such remailers, untraceability is achieved.\\n\\n\\nRECEIVER UNTRACEABILITY -- a method by which you can retrieve a message\\nsent to you, without anyone having any way of knowing that you received the\\nmessage, or indeed if you received any message at all.  \\n\\nHow it works:  anyone wanting to leave a message to you encrypts it with\\nyour public key, and posts it on a \"bulletin board\".  You download all the\\nmessages from the bulletin board periodically, and see if you can decrypt\\nany using your private key.  \\n\\n\\n\\nDIGITAL CASH -- one entity creates some amount of digital \"tokens\", which\\nmay then be transfered to other people, who can transfer them between each\\nother, and when they are returned to their creator, he can not trace the\\ntransactions that have occured, only the total balance of a person at the\\nend of the set of transactions.\\n\\n\\n> a clear explanation of how it can be used and why it matters,\\n\\nEach of these technologies by itself can not accomplish much.  But if all\\nthese are put together, any person can send messages to any other person,\\nwithout anyone but the two of them knowing that a message was sent, or what\\nit said.\\n\\nAs for why it matters, I include here Timothy C. May\\'s Crypto Anarchist\\nManifesto:\\n\\n\\nThe Crypto Anarchist Manifesto\\n\\nTimothy  C.  May\\ntcmay@netcom.com\\n\\n\\nA specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto \\nanarchy. \\n\\nComputer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for \\nindividuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other \\nin a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange \\nmessages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts \\nwithout ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. \\nInteractions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re-\\nrouting of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which \\nimplement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance \\nagainst any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far \\nmore important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. \\nThese developments will alter completely the nature of government \\nregulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the \\nability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of \\ntrust and reputation.\\n\\nThe technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social \\nand economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. \\nThe methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge \\ninteractive proof systems, and various software protocols for \\ninteraction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now \\nbeen on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences \\nmonitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently \\nhave computer networks and  personal computers attained sufficient \\nspeed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten \\nyears will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas \\neconomically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed \\nnetworks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band \\ntransmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips \\nnow under development will be some of the enabling technologies. \\n\\nThe State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this \\ntechnology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology \\nby drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. \\nMany of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow \\nnational secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen \\nmaterials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will \\neven make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and \\nextortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users \\nof CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.\\n\\nJust as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of \\nmedieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will \\ncryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations \\nand of government interference in economic transactions. Combined \\nwith emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a \\nliquid market for any and all material which can be put into words \\nand pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed \\nwire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus \\naltering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the \\nfrontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an \\narcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which \\ndismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.\\n\\nArise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!\\n\\n\\n-- \\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

However, what you mean by trust and what I mean by it\\nmay differ.   In overview, I  will only sign  keys that I  have received\\ndirectly from an individual  that claims to own  the key, and that  I am\\nconfident does so.   My confidence is based  upon the policy I  maintain\\nfor signing keys.\\n\\nPolicy\\n- ------\\n\\n1.  I will only sign a key that I have received physically during a\\n    face-to-face meeting with the person claiming to own the key.\\n\\n2.  I will only sign a key once the claimed key-owner has proved to\\n    me that they possess the secret key corresponding to the public\\n    key that they have given me.\\n\\n3.  I will only  sign a key/ID  pair that I  believe identifies the\\n    person claiming to own the key.\\n\\n4.  I do not  claim to have  verified that the  name the person  is\\n    using is  actually their  own legal  name; I  accept reasonable\\n    aliases/handles but require that I am confident that the person\\n    regularly uses the name given in public.\\n\\n5.  I do not  claim to know  that the key  owner is trustworthy  in\\n    signing keys, and is not an agent provocateur.\\n\\nThe obvious ones:\\n\\n6.  I will not allow my secret key and password to fall into anyone\\n    else\\'s hands.\\n\\n7.  If I find that my secret  key has been compromised, I shall  do\\n    my best to  distribute a compromise  certificate to anyone  who\\n    has received a key with my signature.\\n\\nNotes on Policy\\n- ---------------\\n\\n1.  I will accept keys  presented on paper or  electronically (e.g.\\n    on diskette), but the key  must have been handed over  during a\\n    personal meeting with the (claimed) key-owner.\\n\\n2.  To satisfy me  that the claimed  owner actually *does*  possess\\n    the secret  key, they  must return  to me  a sequence  of bytes\\n    (chosen by me) signed with their secret key and encrypted  with\\n    my public key.\\n\\n    For example,  if I  meet someone  I do  not know  well, and  we\\n    exchange keys, I will not sign their key until I have sent them\\n    a sequence of text bytes (e.g. an item in radix-64 form  signed\\n    by my key),  and they have  returned the same  item to me  in a\\n    message that is signed and  encrypted, and I have checked  that\\n    my  original   `challenge\\'  and   the  returned   response  are\\n    *identical*, and that the  message signature agrees with  their\\n    public key that I posssess.  (Otherwise, the physical  exchange\\n    could well prove nothing about the person involved except  they\\n    possess the public key of the person they are claiming to be.)\\n\\n3.  My signature  says that  the key  and the  associated ID that I\\n    sign belong together, so  far as I can  tell.  In order  not to\\n    mislead you, I won\\'t sign  key/ID pairs that look wrong  to me.\\n    For example, I wouldn\\'t sign  even my own father\\'s key,  if the\\n    ID  said  something  like  `President  of  the United States of\\n    America\\'; because he ain\\'t (and I *know* that!).\\n\\n    If my father\\'s key  also had a (secondary)  ID on it that  gave\\n    his name as I know it, I *would* sign that association, even if\\n    another ID is clearly garbage.\\n\\n4.  I would cheerfully  sign a key/ID  pair, even if  I *knew* that\\n    the ID was not the real ID of the owner, if it is a  reasonable\\n    ID.    For  example,  if  my  Mother  had a stage name, I would\\n    certainly sign her key with that ID; I would also sign her  key\\n    with her maiden name.  I wouldn\\'t sign her key/ID where the  ID\\n    wasn\\'t one  I had  ever heard  her use,  though.   Not even  my\\n    Mother, much as I trust her otherwise!\\n\\n5.  My best  friend, known  since childhood,  may be  a gonzo  when\\n    dealing with security; I have no objection to signing his  key,\\n    but you should not assume  that says anything about whether  or\\n    not I would trust *his* signature myself!  (It\\'s OK, mate, just\\n    joking, I trust you *really*...)\\n\\n-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----\\nVersion: 2.1\\n\\niQCVAgUBKyqRM6soIBpyatDRAQH96AP/RMa0+MENYZ2EZTHZFiS04mgA40A0ncL5\\nrpuRePDrhBjAqxN/K5xX9rWWKgxiQgo3OvsY93tjFUZ1mn4ESUEscf57rnXE26cL\\nB/jEz+Kn4P4en8107ydl5VvZkkqMj3f3Vyfkuu5YN6KX2NIbpVzQgKSrV4Ah8vob\\nF0GKx8DdsOs=\\n=O2fB\\n-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----\\n\\n--\\nTom \\\\/\\\\/illis   | 1. twillis@pintu.demon.co.uk  | Have PGP 2.0 key\\nDGA Ltd         | 2.

It\\'s only useful in electronic form, on your disk. Which is not\\nto say it may be useful to store it on a floppy at some location\\nremoved from the computer in some situations.\\n \\nHowever, PGP has added something called a \"pass phrase\" which you\\ncan assign to your secret key when you generate a key pair. The\\npass phrase is optional, but strongly advised. Since you make it up,\\nit should be easy to memorize, so *don\\'t* write it down or store it\\nanywhere where unfriendly forces could find it.\\n \\nPGP uses the pass phrase you assign to encrypt the stored version of\\nthe secret key it generates for you.  The pass phrase is therefore\\nrequired (and is prompted for) before the secret key can be used to\\neither decrypt incoming mail or sign outgoing mail.\\n \\nThis is your defense against the cops beating down the door.  They\\nwill find the (encrypted) secret key on your disk.  The pass phrase is\\nin your head and you have a right to remain silent; use it.\\n \\nThere might be some situation where a judge could order you to give\\nup the pass phrase: you are granted immunity from criminal prosecution\\n(but you don\\'t want to incriminate your friends) or in a civil\\ndiscovery action.  In this case, just claim to have forgotten the\\npass phrase in the stress of the situation. Stick to that; no-one\\ncan prove otherwise.\\n\\n--\\nedgar@spectrx.saigon.com (Edgar W.

These two are\\nrelated in that what is encrypted with one can only be decrypted with\\nthe other.  It is impossible (computationally infeasible) to derive one\\nknowing the other.  The most popular public key cryptography algorithm\\nis RSA, which is based on the ease of multiplying large primes, and the\\ndifficulty of factoring the product.\\n\\nHow it is used: you publish the public key, while keeping the private\\nkey to yourself.  Anyone can send a secret message to you by encrypting\\nit with your public key.  You are the only one that can decrypt the\\nmessage, since only you have the private key.\\n\\nYou can reply by encrypting your message with their public key, and\\nthey can decrypt it with their private key.\\n\\n\\nDIGITAL SIGNATURES -- techniques that are used to verify that a message\\nclaiming to be from you was actually written by you.  To do that, you\\ncompute a \"message digest\", which is similar to a \"checksum\" in that it\\ncan be used to check that the message has not been altered.  Then you\\nencrypt the \"digest\" with your private key and attach to the message.\\nCurrently the most popular \"digest\" algorithm is MD5.\\n\\nTo verify a signature:  the person verifying computes the same\\nchecksum, then decrypts the checksum attached to the message.  If the\\ntwo match, the message must have been signed by you, since no-one else\\nhas your private key, and could not have generated the signature.\\n\\n\\nDIFFEY-HELLMANN KEY EXCHANGE --  a protocol by which two communicating\\nparties can arrive at a secret piece of information that can not be\\nknown to a passive eavesdropper (as in a wiretap), and can not be\\nrecovered from analysis of recorded communication.  This secret piece\\nof information is usually used as the key for a conventional\\ncryptography algorithm such as DES or IDEA to encrypt following\\ncommunication.\\n\\nThis can be used, for example, for secure telephones.  Two people with\\nthese phones connect through the usual telephone network, push the \"go\\nsecure\" button, the phones perform Diffey-Hellmann key exchange, and\\nencrypt the following conversation with the resulting secret key.\\n\\nNot that these two people did not have to meet in person, or transmit a\\nkey through any other channel.  The key was generated as needed.\\n\\nAfter the conversation is finished, both phones erase the key from\\ntheir memory.  For the next conversation, a new key is set up.\\n\\nSomeone who has a recording of a wiretap has absolutely no way of\\nknowing what they key was, and therefore can not decode the\\nconversation.\\n\\nThis technology makes wiretaps obsolete.\\n\\n\\nSENDER UNTRACEABILITY -- use of a protocol by which one of a group of\\ncommunicating entities can send a public message, while it is impossible\\nto trace the message to the sender.  This can be used to send messages\\nanonymously or pseudonymously and untraceably.  One of the protocols\\nthat makes this possible is David Chaum\\'s dc-net protocol, in which\\nevery participant sends some data, and when all the data are combined,\\nthe anonymous message emerges.  This has been called the \"cryptographic\\nouja board\", because a message appears, but it is impossible to find\\nout who sent it.  If one-time pads are used, this system is\\nunconditionally secure, which means that even an enemy with an infinite\\namount of time and processing power van not deduce the sender from\\navailable information.\\n\\nAnother sender untraceability system is the mix-net, or \"remailer\"\\napproach.  In this case, you send your message to a re-mailer, with\\nencrypted instructions on where to send it.  By sending your message\\nthrough a chain of such remailers, untraceability is achieved.  This\\ndepends on the remailers not keeping logs that can correlate incoming\\nand outgoing messages, or unwillingness to reveal such logs to your\\nenemy.\\n\\n\\nRECEIVER UNTRACEABILITY -- a method by which you can retrieve a message\\nsent to you, without anyone having any way of knowing that you received\\nthe message, or indeed if you received any message at all.\\n\\nHow it works:  anyone wanting to leave a message to you encrypts it\\nwith your public key, and posts it on a \"bulletin board\".  You download\\nall the messages from the bulletin board periodically, and see if you\\ncan decrypt any using your private key.\\n\\nSince everyone downloads all the messages, and THEN attempts to decrypt\\nthem on their own machine, no-one observing the communications link has\\nany way of knowing who received what message, or even if someone\\nreceived any messages at all.  This system, along with the dc-net, can\\nprovide completely untraceable global communications.  It does,\\nhowever, require substantial communications bandwidth and storage\\ncapacity.\\n\\n\\n\\nDIGITAL CASH -- one entity creates some amount of digital \"tokens\",\\nwhich may then be transferred to other people, who can transfer them\\nbetween each other, and when they are returned to their creator, he can\\nnot trace the transactions that have occurred, only the total balance of\\na person at the end of the set of transactions.\\n\\nThis combines the anonymity and untraceability of cash with the\\nconvenience and efficiency of electronic transactions.  In combination\\nwith the above systems, it is superior to cash since any person can pay\\nanyone else, anonymously and untraceably, without having to meet in\\nperson.\\n\\nDavid Friedman asks: \"How can it be used, and why does it matter?\"\\n\\nEach of these technologies by itself can not accomplish much.  But if\\nall these are put together, any person can send messages to any other\\nperson, or transact business without anyone but the two of them knowing\\nwhat occurred, or, even that something at all occurred between these two\\npersons.\\n\\nFurthermore, these two people don\\'t need to know anything about each\\nother, but their public key.  They can be completely anonymous, or use\\na pseudonym.\\n\\nAs for why it matters, I include here Timothy C. May\\'s Crypto Anarchist\\nManifesto:\\n\\n\\nThe Crypto Anarchist Manifesto\\n\\nTimothy C. May\\ntcmay@netcom.com\\n\\n\\nA specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.\\n\\nComputer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for\\nindividuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a\\ntotally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct\\nbusiness, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the\\nTrue Name, or legal identity, of the other.  Interactions over networks\\nwill be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and\\ntamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly\\nperfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central\\nimportance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings\\nof today.  These developments will alter completely the nature of\\ngovernment regulation, the ability to tax and control economic\\ninteractions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even\\nalter the nature of trust and reputation.\\n\\nThe technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social\\nand economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade.\\nThe methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge\\ninteractive proof systems, and various software protocols for\\ninteraction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now\\nbeen on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences\\nmonitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently\\nhave computer networks and  personal computers attained sufficient\\nspeed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years\\nwill bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically\\nfeasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN,\\ntamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites,  Ku-band transmitters,\\nmulti-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under\\ndevelopment will be some of the enabling technologies.\\n\\nThe State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this\\ntechnology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by\\ndrug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration.\\nMany of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow\\nnational secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen\\nmaterials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make\\npossible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various\\ncriminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But\\nthis will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.\\n\\nJust as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of\\nmedieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic\\nmethods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of\\ngovernment interference in economic transactions. Combined with\\nemerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid\\nmarket for any and all material which can be put into words and\\npictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made\\npossible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering\\nforever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West,\\nso too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of\\nmathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed\\nwire around intellectual property.\\n\\nArise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!\\n\\n\\n--\\n..........................................................................\\nTimothy C.

You include this\\nenvelope with your outgoing message, and the respondant places the\\nenvelope at the front of any messages to be sent back to you.  The\\nenvelope is a nested encrypted set of Anon-To: lines that remailers\\nstrip off as the message is routed back to you.\\n\\nThis system has at least two weaknesses for future use, however.  The\\nmost serious is that the body of the reply is not altered by the\\nremailers, allowing the message to be more easily traced.  The second\\nis that there is no provision for remailers to charge for the service.\\nIf postage is included in the envelope itself, it becomes a single use\\ndevice; it is useless for posting to a newsgroup, for example.\\n\\nBoth of these problems can be solved by having each remailer forward\\nthe message *with*postage*due*.  What that means is that the remailer\\nencrypts the message before sending it on, and saves the key used in\\nan account file along with a message id and the amount due.  The body\\nis thus altered on each hop, complicating the process of tracing the\\nmessage.  You also are unable to read the message until you have paid\\nthe postage on it, which you do by sending a message to yourself via a\\nsimilar envelope.  That message contains stamps which get removed at\\neach step by the remailers, and replaced with the necessary key for\\nreading the mail.  When you recieve the second message back, you have\\nthe necessary info to read the first, and have paid for its delivery.\\n\\nA variation would allow the respondant to include the necessary\\npostage (you need to specify how much, thus compromising at least the\\nhop count of your route).  To keep each remailer\\'s postage seperate,\\nkey pairs could be generated, with the public portion kept outside the\\nenvelope, and the secret portion sealed within the envelope, openable\\nonly by a single remailer.  The postage would be wrapped up in\\nsuccessive keys as specified on the outside of the envelope.  The\\nenvelope would then specify the keys to be used by each remailer to\\ntransform the body.\\n\\nAll of this requires defining a message as containing an envelope and\\na contents.  The envelope must be able to specify how the contents are\\nto be encrypted at each hop. Perhaps the envelope could be placed in\\nthe header of the message as a single field.\\n\\nDetails still need to be worked out.

Among the topics likely to be\\ndiscussed are:\\n\\n  o   The proliferation of public key cryptography in the U.K.\\n  o   The local development of anonymous remailers and a proposed\\n        automated public key repository at Demon Internet Systems\\n  o   Electronic networking/email security for the novice\\n  o   Pro-active proliferation of PGP 2.1+ to interesting European,\\n        African, and Asian sites\\n        -  ftp placement\\n        -  BBS distribution\\n        -  sneakernet across borders\\n  o   The use of HPACK in securing local file installations\\n\\n.. and much more!\\n\\nMark Turner, from Demon Internet Systems, is likely to be on hand to\\ndemo DIS for non-DIS users.  We\\'ve set up our own local, high-quality\\nnewsgroups:\\n         demon.security\\n         demon.security.keys\\n\\nand established the /pub/pgp and /pub/ibmpc/pgp archives on\\ngate.demon.co.uk (expanding recently to include all versions of PGP,\\nand interesting related files).\\n\\nHope to see you there!\\n\\nSemper vigilans,\\nSemper vigilans,\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrom cypherpunks@MHonArc.venona  Wed Dec 17 23:17:14 2003\\nFrom: yanek@novavax.nova.edu (Yanek Martinson)\\nDate: Thu, 31 Dec 92 16:02:03 PST\\nTo: cypherpunks@toad.com\\nSubject: CFP\\'93 Electronic Brochure 1.2 (fwd)\\nMessage-ID: <9301010001.AA16211@novavax.nova.edu>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain\\n\\n\\nForwarded message:\\n\\n> From: Bruce R Koball <bkoball@well.sf.ca.us>\\n> \\n>   The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy -- CFP\\'93\\n> 9-12 March 1993, San Francisco Airport Marriott Hotel, Burlingame, CA\\n> \\n> Sponsored by: Association for Computing Machinery, \\n>               Special Interest Groups on:\\n>               Communications (SIGCOMM)\\n>               Computers and Society (SIGCAS)\\n>               Security, Audit and Control (SIGSAC)\\n> \\n> Co-Sponsors and Cooperating Organizations:\\n> \\n>       American Civil Liberties Union\\n>       American Library Association\\n>       Asociacion de Technicos de Informatica\\n>       Commission for Liberties and Informatics\\n>       Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility\\n>       Electronic Frontier Foundation\\n>       Freedom to Read Foundation\\n>       IEEE Computer Society\\n>       IEEE-USA Committee on Communications and Information Policy\\n>       Internet Society\\n>       Library and Information Technology Association\\n>       Privacy International\\n>       USD Center for Public Interest Law\\n>       U.S. Privacy Council\\n>       The WELL (Whole Earth \\'Lectronic Link)\\n> \\n> Patrons and Supporters (as of 24 December 1992):\\n> \\n>       American Express Corp.\\n>       Apple Computer, Inc.\\n>       Dun & Bradstreet Corp.\\n>       Equifax, Inc.\\n>       Information Resource Service Company\\n>       Mead Data Central, Inc.\\n>       National Science Foundation (pending)\\n>       RSA Data Security, Inc.\\n> \\n> \\n> CFP\\'93 Electronic Brochure 1.2\\n> \\n\\n> \\n> SCOPE:\\n> \\n> The advance of computer and telecommunications technologies holds great \\n> promise for individuals and society. From convenience for consumers and \\n> efficiency in commerce to improved public health and safety and \\n> increased participation in democratic institutions, these technologies \\n> can fundamentally transform our lives.\\n> \\n> At the same time these technologies pose threats to the ideals of a free \\n> and open society. Personal privacy is increasingly at risk from invasion \\n> by high-tech surveillance and eavesdropping. The myriad databases \\n> containing personal information maintained in the public and private \\n> sectors expose private life to constant scrutiny.\\n> \\n> Technological advances also enable new forms of illegal activity, posing \\n> new problems for legal and law enforcement officials and challenging the \\n> very definitions of crime and civil liberties. But technologies used to \\n> combat these crimes can pose new threats to freedom and privacy.\\n> \\n> Even such fundamental notions as speech, assembly and property are being \\n> transformed by these technologies, throwing into question the basic \\n> Constitutional protections that have guarded them. Similarly, \\n> information knows no borders; as the scope of economies becomes global \\n> and as networked communities transcend international boundaries, ways \\n> must be found to reconcile competing political, social and economic \\n> interests in the digital domain.\\n> \\n> The Third Conference on Computers, Freedom and Privacy will assemble \\n> experts, advocates and interested people from a broad spectrum of \\n> disciplines and backgrounds in a balanced public forum to address the \\n> impact of computer and telecommunications technologies on freedom and \\n> privacy in society. Participants will include people from the fields of \\n> computer science, law, business, research, information, library science, \\n> health, public policy, government, law enforcement, public advocacy and \\n> many others.\\n> \\n\\n> \\n> General Chair\\n> -------------\\n> Bruce R.

These presentations will range from interesting\\n> and informative to thought-provoking and controversial. The tutorials\\n> are available at a nominal additional registration cost.\\n> \\n> Conference Reception:\\n> Following the Tutorials on Tuesday evening, you are invited to meet new \\n> and old friends and colleagues at an opening reception. \\n> \\n> Single Track Main Program:\\n> The technological revolution that is driving change in our society has\\n> many facets and we are often unaware of the way they all fit together,\\n> especially the parts that lie outside of our own expertise and interest.\\n> The primary goal of CFP\\'93 is to bring together individuals from\\n> disparate disciplines and backgrounds, and engage them in a balanced\\n> discussion of all CFP issues. To this end our main program, starting on\\n> Wednesday 10 March, is on a single track enabling our attendees to take\\n> part in all sessions.\\n> \\n> Registration is Limited:\\n> CFP\\'93 registration will be limited to 550 attendees, so we advise you \\n> to register as early as possible and take advantage of the early \\n> registration discounts.\\n> \\n> Luncheons and Banquets:\\n> A key component of the CFP conferences has been the interaction between\\n> the diverse communities that constitute our attendees. To promote this\\n> interaction CFP\\'93 is providing three luncheons and evening two banquets\\n> with the cost of conference registration.\\n> \\n> EFF Pioneer Awards\\n> All conference attendees are invited to the Awards Reception sponsored \\n> by the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) on Wednesday evening, 10 \\n> March. These, the second annual EFF Pioneer Awards, will be given to \\n> individuals and organizations that have made distinguished contributions \\n> to the human and technological realms touched by computer-based \\n> communications.\\n> \\n> Birds of a Feather Sessions:\\n> CFP\\'93 will provide a limited number of meeting rooms to interested \\n> individuals for special Birds of a Feather sessions after the formal \\n> program each evening. These sessions will provide an opportunity for \\n> special interest discussions that were not included in the formal \\n> program and will be listed in the conference materials.

In \\n> his role as commissioner, he quickly became an outspoken consumer \\n> advocate, attacking network abuses and insisting that those who use the \\n> frequencies under the FCC license are the public\\'s trustees. He has been \\n> a visiting professor of law at the College of Law at the University of \\n> Iowa since 1981 and is currently co-director of the Institute for \\n> Health, Behavior and Environmental Policy at the University of Ohio.\\n> \\n> Willis H. Ware\\n>  \\n> Willis H. Ware has devoted his career to all aspects of computer \\n> science--hardware, software, architectures, software development, public \\n> policy and legislation. He chaired the \"HEW committee\" whose report was \\n> the foundation for the Federal Privacy Act of 1974. President Ford \\n> appointed him to the Privacy Protection Study Commission whose report \\n> remains the most extensive examination of private sector record-keeping \\n> practices.  Dr. Ware is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, \\n> a Fellow of the Institute of Electronic and Electrical Engineers, and a \\n> Fellow of the American Association for Advancement of Science.\\n> \\n> John Perry Barlow \\n> \\n> John Perry Barlow is a retired Wyoming cattle rancher, a lyricist for \\n> the Grateful Dead, and a co-founder of the Electronic Frontier \\n> Foundation. He graduated from Wesleyan University with an honors degree \\n> in comparative religion. He writes and lectures on subjects relating to \\n> digital technology and society, and is a contributing editor of numerous \\n> publications, including Communications of the ACM, NeXTworld, \\n> MicroTimes, and Mondo 2000.\\n> \\n> Cliff Stoll\\n> \\n> Cliff Stoll is best known for tracking a computer intruder across the \\n> international networks in 1987; he told this story in his book, \"The \\n> Cuckoo\\'s Egg\" and on a Nova television production. He is less known for \\n> having a PhD in planetary science, piecing quilts, making plum jam, and \\n> squeezing lumps of bituminous coal into diamonds.\\n> \\n\\n> \\n> CFP\\'93 Tutorials:\\n> \\n> Tuesday 9 March - Morning Tutorials\\n> \\n> Information Use in the Private Sector\\n> Jack Reed, Information Resource Service Company\\n> Diane Terry, TransUnion Corp.    Dan Jones, D.Y. Jones & Assoc.\\n> \\n> This tutorial will deal with the use of personal information from the\\n> point of view of some private sector information vendors and users. It\\n> will include a discussion of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the\\n> \"Permissible Purposes\" for obtaining a consumer credit report.\\n> Information used for purposes outside the FCRA will be discussed in\\n> relationship to privacy and societal needs for businesses and\\n> individuals.\\n> \\n> Access to Government Information:\\n> James Love, Director, Taxpayer Assets Project\\n> \\n> The tutorial will examine a wide range of problems concerning citizen \\n> access to government information, including how to ask for and receive \\n> information under the federal Freedom of Information Act, what types of \\n> information government agencies store on computers, what the barriers \\n> are to citizen access to these information resources, and how citizens \\n> can change government information policy to expand access to taxpayer-\\n> funded information resources.\\n> \\n> Exploring the Internet -- a guided journey\\n> Mark Graham, Pandora Systems\\tTim Pozar, Late Night Software\\n> \\n> This tutorial will give participants a practical introduction to the \\n> most popular and powerful applications available via the world\\'s largest \\n> computer network, the Internet.  There will be hands-on demonstrations \\n> of communications tools such as e-mail, conferencing, Internet Relay \\n> Chat, and resource discovery and navigation aids such as Gopher, WAIS, \\n> Archie and World Wide Web. Extensive documentation will be provided.\\n> \\n> Constitutional Law for Non-lawyers (1/2 session):\\n> Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation\\n> \\n> This tutorial is designed to inform non-lawyers about the Constitutional \\n> issues that underlie computer-crime and computer civil-liberties cases.  \\n> The tutorial focuses on the First and Fourth Amendments, but includes a \\n> discussion of the Fifth Amendment and its possible connection to the \\n> compelled disclosure of cryptographic keys. It also includes a \\n> discussion of the appropriateness of \"original intent\" as a method for \\n> applying the Constitution in the modern era.\\n> \\n> Civil Liberties Implications of Computer Searches & Seizures (1/2 ses.):\\n> Mike Godwin, Staff Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation\\n> \\n> This tutorial assumes only a very basic knowledge of Constitutional law \\n> (the prior tutorial provides an adequate background), and outlines how \\n> searches and seizures of computers may raise issues of First and Fourth \\n> Amendment rights, as well as of federal statutory protections. It \\n> includes a discussion of what proper search-and-seizure techniques in \\n> such cases may be. \\n> \\n\\n> \\n> Tuesday 9 March - Afternoon Tutorials\\n> \\n> Practical Data Inferencing: What we THINK we know about you.\\n> Russell L. Brand, Senior Computer Scientist, Reasoning Systems\\n> \\n> What do your transaction trails reveal about you?  Are you a good risk \\n> to insure?  Are you worth kidnapping, auditing or suing?  Which products \\n> should I target at you?  Are you a member of one of those groups that I \\n> would want to harass or discriminate against? This tutorial will be a \\n> hands-on approach to digging for data and to piecing it back together.  \\n> Time will be divided between malicious personal invasions and sweeping \\n> searches that seek only profit, followed by a brief discussion about \\n> improper inferences and their practical impact on innocent files and \\n> lives. Legal and moral issues will not be addressed.\\n> \\n> Telecommunications Fraud\\n> Donald P. Delaney, Senior Investigator, New York State Police\\n> \\n> Illegal call sell operations in New York City are estimated to be a \\n> billion dollar industry. This tutorial will provide an overview of the \\n> problem, from finger hacking to pay phone enterprises, and will include \\n> an up-to-date assessment of the computer cracker/hacker/phone phreak \\n> impact on telephone company customer losses. Also discussed will be \\n> unlawful access of telephone company switches; unlawful wiretapping and \\n> monitoring; cards, codes and 950 numbers; New York State law and police \\n> enforcement; methods of investigation and case studies.\\n> \\n> Private Sector Marketplace and Workplace Privacy \\n> Ernest A. Kallman, Bentley College, H. Jeff Smith, Georgetown University\\n> \\n> This tutorial will give participants a general overview of privacy \\n> issues affecting uses of personal information (e.g., medical \\n> information, financial information, purchase histories) in the \\n> marketplace as well as privacy concerns in the workplace (e.g., privacy \\n> of electronic and voice mail, work monitoring).  The tutorial will also \\n> set the boundaries for privacy arguments in the middle and latter 1990s.\\n> \\n> SysLaw\\n> Lance Rose, Attorney and Author \"SysLaw\"\\n> \\n> The SysLaw tutorial session will explore in depth the freedom and\\n> privacy issues encountered by computer bulletin boards (BBS), their\\n> system operators and their users.  BBSs are estimated to number over\\n> 45,000 today (not counting corporate systems), and range from small,\\n> spare-time hobby systems to systems with thousands of users, grossing\\n> millions of dollars.  BBSs are a grassroots movement with an entry cost\\n> of $1,000 or less, and the primary vehicles for new forms of electronic\\n> communities and services. Subjects covered will include: First Amendment\\n> protection for the BBS as publisher/distributor; data freedom and\\n> property rights on the BBS; how far can sysops control BBS user\\n> activities?; and user privacy on BBSs today.\\n> \\n> Note: Tutorial presenters will offer expert opinions and information.\\n> Some may advocate particular viewpoints and thus may put their own\\n> \"spin\" on the issues. Caveat Listener. \\n> \\n\\n> \\n> CFP\\'93 Main Program Sessions: \\n> \\n> Wednesday 10 March\\n> \\n> Electronic Democracy\\n> Chair - Jim Warren, MicroTimes and Autodesk, Inc.\\n> \\n> The effects of computer and telecommunications technologies on \\n> democratic processes and institutions are increasing dramatically. This \\n> session will explore their impacts on political organizing, campaigning, \\n> access to representatives and agencies, and access to government \\n> information that is essential for a free press and an informed \\n> electorate.\\n> \\n> Electronic Voting -- Threats to Democracy\\n> Chair - Rebecca Mercuri, University of Pennsylvania\\n> \\n> This panel session will invite representatives covering a broad spectrum \\n> of involvement with the controversial subject of electronic vote \\n> tallying to address such issues as: Is a secure and reliable electronic \\n> voting system feasible? What threats to these systems are identifiable? \\n> Should electronic voting systems be open for thorough examination? Can \\n> auditability be assured in an anonymous ballot setting? Can voting by \\n> phone be practical and confidential? Did Congress exempt voting machines \\n> from the Computer Security Act?\\n> \\n> Censorship and Free Speech on the Networks\\n> Chair - Barbara Simons, IBM\\n> \\n> As online forums become increasingly pervasive, the notion of \"community \\n> standards\" becomes harder to pin down. Networks and BBSs will link--or \\n> create--diverse, non-geographic communities with differing standards, \\n> laws, customs and mores. What may be frank discussion in one forum may \\n> be obscenity or defamation or sexual harassment in another. This session \\n> will explore the questions of what kinds of freedom-of-speech problems \\n> face us on the Net and what kinds of legal and social solutions we need.\\n> \\n> Portrait of the Artist on the Net\\n> Chair - Anna Couey, Arts Wire\\n> \\n> Computer forums and networks make possible both new artforms and new \\n> ways of remote collaboration and exhibition. The growth of the Net \\n> creates opportunities for the blossoming of dynamic and interactive \\n> artforms and of artistic cultures -- provided that networks become \\n> widely accessible and remain open to artistic expression without \\n> political interference. This session will examine the potentials and the \\n> problems of art and artists on the Net.\\n> \\n> \\n\\n> \\n> Thursday 11 March\\n> \\n> Digital Telephony and Crypto Policy\\n> Chair - John Podesta, Podesta and Associates\\n> \\n> The increasingly digital nature of telecommunications potentially \\n> threatens the ability of law enforcement agencies to intercept them when \\n> legally authorized to do so. In addition, the potential widespread use \\n> of cryptography may render the ability to intercept a communication \\n> moot. This session will examine these issues and the proposals that \\n> have been put before Congress by law enforcement agencies to address \\n> these perceived problems.\\n> \\n> Health Records and Confidentiality\\n> Chair - Janlori Goldman, American Civil Liberties Union\\n> \\n> As the new Administration and Congress consider proposals to reform the \\n> United States health care system, it is imperative that confidentiality \\n> and security safeguards be put in place to protect personal information. \\n> Currently, no comprehensive legislation exists on the confidentiality of \\n> health information. This session will explore the current and potential \\n> uses of health care information, and proposals to safeguard the \\n> information.\\n> \\n> The Many Faces of Privacy\\n> Chair  - Willis Ware, Rand Corp.\\n> \\n> Privacy at any cost is foolish, unwise and an untenable position, and \\n> privacy at zero cost is a myth. This two-part session will explore the \\n> balancing act between the two extremes and the costs and benefits that \\n> accrue. The first part will present several examples of systems and \\n> applications in the public and private sectors that stake out a position \\n> in this continuum.   The second part will be a panel discussion \\n> exploring the issues raised by the examples previously presented.\\n> \\n> The Digital Individual\\n> Chair - Max Nelson-Kilger, San Jose State University\\n> \\n> We are all represented by personal records in countless databases. As \\n> these records are accumulated, disseminated and coalesced, each of us is \\n> shadowed by an ever larger and more detailed data alter-ego, which \\n> increasingly stands in for us in many situations without our permission \\n> or even awareness. How does this happen? How does it affect us? How will \\n> it develop in the future? What can we do? This session will investigate \\n> these questions.\\n> \\n\\n> \\n> Friday 12 March\\n> \\n> Gender Issues in Computing and Telecommunications\\n> Chair - Judi Clark, Bay Area Women in Telecommunications\\n> \\n> Online environments are largely determined by the viewpoints of their\\n> users and programmers, still predominantly white men. This panel will\\n> discuss issues of freedom and privacy that tend to affect women -- such\\n> as access, identity, harassment, pornography and online behavior -- and\\n> provide recommendations for gender equity policies to bulletin board\\n> operators and system administrators.\\n> \\n> The Hand That Wields the Gavel\\n> Chair - Don Ingraham, Asst. District Attorney, Alameda County, CA\\n> \\n> An inevitable result of the settlement of Cyberspace is the adaptation\\n> of the law to its particular effects. In this session  a panel of\\n> criminal lawyers addresses the fallout from a hypothetical computer\\n> virus on the legal responsibilities of system managers and operators.\\n> The format will be a simulated court hearing. Attendees will act as\\n> advisory jurors in questioning and in rendering a verdict.\\n> \\n> The Power, Politics, and Promise of Internetworking\\n> Chair- Jerry Berman, Electronic Frontier Foundation\\n> \\n> This session will explore the development of internetworking \\n> infrastructures, domestically and worldwide. How will this \\n> infrastructure and its applications be used by the general public?  What \\n> will the global network look like to the average user from Kansas to \\n> Kiev?  How will politics, technology and legislation influence the \\n> access to, and cost of, the Net?  How can the potential of this powerful \\n> medium be fully realized?\\n> \\n> International Data Flow\\n> Chair - George Trubow, John Marshall Law School\\n> \\n> The trans-border flow of information on international computer networks \\n> has been a concern for governments and the private sector. In addition \\n> to concerns for privacy and data security, the economic and national \\n> security implications of this free flow of information among scientists, \\n> engineers and researchers around the world are also cause for concern. \\n> This session will assemble a number of speakers to compare the various \\n> perspectives on the problem \\n> \\n> \\n\\n> \\n> Some of the Speakers in the CFP\\'93 Main Program: \\n> \\n> Phillip E.

These changes are based on constructive comments from over\\ntwenty people. These changes may encourage folks to distribute RSAREF\\nand RIPEM who otherwise would not have.\\n\\nWe plan to make all RSAREF applications (such as RIPEM) availble WITH\\nRSAREF.  Why shouldn\\'t someone get all the stuff built on it if they\\nget RSAREF? (Including helpful code such as the Thompson/Schiller\\nemacs adapter.) I assume you have no objection.\\n\\nI\\'m hopeful that you see these changes as positive; please let me know\\nif that\\'s not true! I offer a summary of them, the rationale,\\nperceived benefits, and a complete copy of the revised license.\\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHere\\'s a summary of the changes between what\\'s attached (the one we\\nplan to now \"standardize\" on for RSAREF) and what you sent me:\\n\\nchanged 1(a) and added (8): the license is now perpetual. Some have\\nclaimed RSA might \"suddenly\" decide to cancel RSAREF licenses. It is\\nnow crystal clear that the license can only be cancelled by violating\\nthe agreement. RSA cannot cancel it at its discretion. And even if you\\nviolate it, it doesn\\'t cancel the license of those who got it from\\nyou. I think this is an importnat clarification, from what I\\'ve heard.\\n\\nchanged 1(c) and added 2(d): We don\\'t care about any porting or\\nperformance mods, but we don\\'t feel we should allow automatic access\\nunder the normal interface. We\\'ve granted it to you since RIPEM\\npredates RSAREF (also to John Gilmore for a secure RLOGIN using\\nDiffie-Hellman) and we\\'ll grant it to anyone for any reasonable use.\\n(We state so in the Agreement.)  We just want to know what it is we\\'re\\nallowing to go around the interface.\\n\\nEnd of Section 1 - a clarification in the form of an addition is made\\nhere. Some have said that unrelated software on a tape with RSAREF\\ncould be covered by the restrictions imposed on RSAREF Application\\nPrograms. This should clear that up. (I believe this helps you in the\\nseparate distribution of the RIPEM code minus the RSAREF code.)\\n\\nchanged (6): We simply have removed RSA\\'s $5,000 cap on protecting\\nRSAREF users against charges from some other patent holders. (Like\\nPKP!) Some have claimed that RSAREF was posibly a way to \"set up\"\\nusers for PKP (the patent holders) since $5K was hardly enough to\\ndefend against patent infringement.  (They actually thought RSAREF was\\na way to get people to infringe just so that PKP could sue them! RSA\\npays $5,000, but PKP collects more, therefore it\\'s a \\'you hold em, and\\nI\\'ll hit em\\' thing, or so I guess they thought.) I believe this makes\\nit clear we intend to sue no one for using RSAREF, and in fact defend\\nusers ALL THE WAY if someone else does.\\n\\nI think these are all for the better, and will engender trust in RSA\\'s\\nintentions with RSAREF, to support free PEM.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNew RSAREF License  (December 1992 version)\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n                           RSA LABORATORIES\\n                      PROGRAM LICENSE AGREEMENT\\n\\n\\n\\nRSA LABORATORIES, A DIVISION OF RSA DATA SECURITY, INC.

RSA grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,\\n     perpetual (subject to the conditions of section 8) license\\n     for the \"RSAREF\" program (the \"Program\") and its associated\\n     documentation, subject to all of the following terms and\\n     conditions:\\n\\n     a.   to use the Program on any computer in your possession;\\n\\n     b.   to make copies of the Program for back-up purposes;\\n\\n     c.   to modify the Program in any manner for porting or\\n          performance improvement purposes (subject to Section 2)\\n          or to incorporate the  Program into other computer programs \\n          for your own personal or internal use, provided that you \\n          provide RSA with a copy  of any such modification or \\n          Application Program by electronic mail, and grant RSA \\n          a perpetual, royalty-free license to use and distribute \\n          such modifications and Application Programs on the terms \\n          set forth in this Agreement.\\n\\n     d.   to copy and distribute the Program and Application Programs\\n          in accordance with the limitations set forth in Section 2.\\n\\n\"Application Programs\" are programs which incorporate all or any\\nportion of the Program in any form. The restrictions imposed on\\nApplication Programs in this Agreement shall not apply to any software\\nwhich, through the mere aggregation on distribution media, is\\nco-located or stored with the Program.\\n\\n2.   LIMITATIONS ON LICENSE.\\n\\n     a.   RSA owns the Program and its associated documentation and\\n          all copyrights therein. You may only use, copy, modify and\\n          distribute the Program as expressly provided for in this\\n          Agreement. You must reproduce and include this Agreement,\\n          RSA\\'s copyright notices and disclaimer of warranty on any\\n          copy and its associated documentation.\\n\\n     b.   The Program and all Application Programs are to be used only\\n          for non-commercial purposes. However, media costs associated\\n          with the distribution of the Program or Application Programs\\n          may be recovered.\\n\\n     c.   The Program, if modified, must carry prominent notices\\n          stating that changes have been made, and the dates of any\\n          such changes. \\n\\n     d.   Prior permission from RSA is required for\\n          any modifications that access the Program through ways\\n          other than the published Program interface or for \\n          modifications to the Program interface. RSA will grant\\n          all reasonable requests for permission to make such\\n          modifications.\\n\\n3.   NO RSA OBLIGATION. You are solely responsible for all of your\\n     costs and expenses incurred in connection with the distribution\\n     of the Program or any Application Program hereunder, and RSA\\n     shall have no liability, obligation or responsibility therefor.\\n     RSA shall have no obligation to provide maintenance, support,\\n     upgrades or new releases to you or to any distributee of the\\n     Program or any Application Program.\\n\\n4.

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED FOR IN\\n     SECTION 6 HEREINUNDER, NEITHER RSA NOR ANY OTHER PERSON WHO HAS\\n     BEEN INVOLVED IN THE CREATION, PRODUCTION, OR DELIVERY OF THE\\n     PROGRAM SHALL BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY\\n     DIRECT, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF RSA HAS BEEN\\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\\n\\n6.   PATENT INFRINGEMENT OBLIGATION. Subject to the limitations set\\n     forth below, RSA, at its own expense, shall: (i) defend, or at\\n     its option settle, any claim, suit or proceeding against you on\\n     the basis of infringement of any United States patent in the\\n     field of cryptography by the unmodified Program; and (ii) pay\\n     any final judgment or settlement entered against you on such\\n     issue in any such suit or proceeding defended by RSA. The\\n     obligations of RSA under this Section 6 are subject to: \\n     (i) RSA\\'s having sole control of the defense of any such claim, \\n     suit or proceeding; (ii) your notifying RSA promptly in writing\\n     of each such claim, suit or  proceeding and giving RSA authority\\n     to proceed as stated in this  Section 6; and (iii) your giving \\n     RSA all information known to you relating to such claim, \\n     suit or proceeding and cooperating  with RSA to defend any such \\n     claim, suit or proceeding. RSA shall have no obligation under \\n     this Section 6 with respect to any claim to the extent it is \\n     based upon (A) use of the Program  as modified by any person \\n     other than RSA or use of any Application Program, where use \\n     of the unmodified Program would not constitute an infringement, \\n     or (B) use of the Program in a manner other than that permitted \\n     by this Agreement.  THIS SECTION 6 SETS FORTH RSA\\'S ENTIRE \\n     OBLIGATION AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES CONCERNING CLAIMS FOR  \\n     PROPRIETARY RIGHTS INFRINGEMENT.\\n\\n     NOTE: Portions of the Program practice methods described in and\\n     subject to U.S. Patents Nos. 4,200,770, 4,218,582 and 4,405,829,\\n     and all foreign counterparts and equivalents, issued to Leland\\n     Stanford Jr. University and to Massachusetts Institute of\\n     Technology.

This Agreement does not grant or convey any\\n     interest whatsoever in such patents.\\n\\n7.   RSAREF is a non-commercial publication of cryptographic\\n     techniques. Portions of RSAREF have been published in the\\n     International Security Handbook and the August 1992 issue of Dr.\\n     Dobb\\'s Journal. Privacy applications developed with RSAREF may be\\n     subject to export controls. If you are located in the United States\\n     and develop such applications, you are advised to consult with the\\n     State Department\\'s Office of Defense Trade Controls.\\n\\n8.   TERM. The license granted hereunder is effective until\\n     terminated. You may terminate it at anytime by destroying\\n     the Program and its associated documentation. The termination\\n     of your license will not result in the termination of the\\n     licenses of any distributees who have received rights to the\\n     Program through you so long as they are in compliance with\\n     the provisions of this license.\\n\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
