This approach can significantly increase the TPS rate while maintaining a high level of decentralization.

another approach would be the use of Side Chains,   these are separate blockchains that are pegged to the main Bitcoin blockchain and allow for the processing of transactions in parallel.
Sidechains can be used for specific use cases, such as smart contracts or asset tokenization, and can help to reduce the load on the main Bitcoin blockchain while maintaining decentralization.",Re: Bitcoin Blockchain Transactions Per Second,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445412.msg61937077#msg61937077,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445412.0

lightning has many scalability issues. they have liquidity problems in regards to routing which only get worse the more popular it gets

as for bitcoins tx/s
bitcoin does 2016 blocks a fortnight meaning 1 block every 600 seconds average
bitcoin only does about 2300tx a block

2300/600=3.83per second
3000tx a block would be 5tx/s


the 7tx/s was the ""expectation"" of the old 1mb limit and lean 226byte tx

That is a useless comparison.

I don't want to use a payment method with a chargeback option. With VISA, it can be up to 120 days which would be a period I can sleep well.

If you paid with a Visa debit, credit or pre-paid card, a chargeback is an option. If you need to make a chargeback claim, make sure you do it within 120 days of purchase.

With Bitcoin, 3 confirmations are good to go and if it is a transaction with big amount, 6 confirmations are enough for me to be safe. 6 confirmations equal to about 1 hour that is much shorter than 120 days.

Choosing between two options, sleep well after 1 hour and can not sleep well within 120 days. Make your choice!

How many Bitcoin confirmations is enough?",Re: Bitcoin Blockchain Transactions Per Second,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445412.msg61938815#msg61938815,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445412.0

In that case, usually you're looking for blocksize increase or make Bitcoin transaction structure become more efficient.

It's not just about code, it's about compromise.  Throughput has a cost.  Those who secure the chain have to bear that cost.  They have to store and relay the information contained and updated within the blockchain.  Even at the present rate of throughput, this cost increases all the time.  If you wish to increase throughput it subsequently means increasing the rate at which that cost increases.  If you run a node, you can have a small amount of influence over what level of throughput you are prepared to support.  When most nodes are prepared to support more throughput, then it can increase.

nodes dont have influence ANYMORE.. thats the point of your favoured ""backward compatibility"" nodes dont need or get to vote anymore. things are pushed through without node mass agreement..
you have been promoting that feature for a while. so why pretend its the opposite now

you love how core decide without consent. you have been promoting that too how devs shouldnt be told what to do or be censored from doing things they want

you know deep down its core devs that control future decisions not user nodes. they shouldnt have gained that power. but you love that they have

YOU are the guy that doesnt want more transactions but loves the idea of 1 tx having 4mb of bloat in the form of a image file

hey if you think one image file being 4mb in 1 tx is fine for the network.. then please stop crying when others want 4mb of 8000tx, which you cry by saying/suggesting its bad for the network

we are not in the era of 1999 where computers are slow and cannot cope with it.
its 2023 computers can cope with more then you pretend they can

if you truly think 4mb of genuine utility of thousands of transactions(packets of data) is bad. then how come many many other data services to clients of different serves do not have a problem.. EG online gaming. livestreaming, torrents

i do laugh how you want blocks to have 1tx of 4mb but dont want 4mb of 8000tx

users dont have the choice because the only main dev of protocol level coding is core. thus everyone is WAITING and begging for CORE to allow more transaction count, becasue any other brand trying to do it will get REKT. and core as you know have a roadmap of wanting to push people off the network into other networks(you favour) as their plan.. and as you keep saying for the last 6 years ""be patient"" yet all of these topics over the years made by thousands of people wanting transaction scaling on bitcoin shows its not just a minority asking for more tx count onchain

stop pretending its user decision or user fault for no upgrades.. core have become the only party offering ability to upgrade and yet they are not offering the upgrades the people want and only offering upgrades corporations want(gateway formats to lock people into other networks for middlemen rewarding of facilitating payments)",Re: Bitcoin Blockchain Transactions Per Second,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445412.msg61942743#msg61942743,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445412.0
