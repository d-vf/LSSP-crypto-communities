Although the price of Bitcoin is increasing but breaking the resistance of 28500 can be a very good move.if Bitcoin break the resistance of 28500 then Bitcoin can go up to 31000, and once again BTC can make 28500 as a strong support.but it seems difficult to say that it Will go up to 50000 continuously, because once again if BTC rejected from 28000 then BTC can retest 25000 once again.

You never can tell the exact price that bitcoin will rise or fall to, but if you have faith that the price will continue to move in the uptrend and just want to continue to hold that's okay. but, if you are scared that the price might drop then you can simply proceed to sell your coin and I guarantee that nobody is going to judge you for selling.

It happens that bitcoin price can change within a few days. It falls, then it rises, then it falls again. This is the same volatility.

And you're a sly one if you want an easy solution. The problem is that no one can know whether tomorrow btc will rise or fall. So don't take other people's advice seriously.

I think this is a bad time to sell bitcoin. Recall the last btc's peak and think that this level can be reached again. Most likely, it will even be surpassed, since in previous times it was just that. Bitcoin with each bull run exceeded past highs. Selling btc now should only be in case of emergency.",Re: will bitcoin continue to rise,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.msg61933050#msg61933050,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.0

BTC went above both the weekly moving averages now (50 and 200), and invalidated the death cross.
So, as long as it stays above them it will keep going higher. If you have bought at lower levels just keep watching for weekly candles and the MAs.

Long term? Easy, yes. But if your span of period for that price is for this year then it may take time and it's 50/50 of chance to happen. Do remember that halving is about to happen next year and that will trigger the demand and lesser supply for the rewards of miners, in short the impact will go directly to the price assumingly will create a positive impact.

Sell if you need the cash, do not regret selling if there's an important thing you're about to purchase or bills to pay. You don't have to sell all of it and just take a part of portion from your holdings. And if you've got other source of income, upon selling, create a plan that you'll buy those sold bitcoin of yours and do the DCA technique for you not to miss out the next bull run.",Re: will bitcoin continue to rise,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.msg61933142#msg61933142,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.0

Bitcoin does not make one directional movement to a certain point.
It will not just arrived to 50,000 dollars if there is no major bull run. So the Bitcoin price cannot go to 50,000 dollars immediately from 20,000 dollars. The highest you should anticipate for now is that $30,000 and even if at bitcoin 30000 dollars it will still drop down to the range of 20,000 dollars.

if you are buying bitcoin for a long time purpose, there is no need to sell. But if you are buying to hold and wait for it to appreciate, you can sell now and wait for the market to correct and you repeat the process.",Re: will bitcoin continue to rise,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.msg61933224#msg61933224,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.0

You're talking non sense.

Why you think Bitcoin price will keep rising in the next 10+ years? what about the next 20 years or 30 years? Bitcoin will keep increasing no matter what because there's no other decentralized currency created until now.

If Bitcoin price increased due to good economy, recently there are 2 banks are collapsed and the banks borrowed huge money from federal reserve, which mean the whole economy condition aren't good enough.",Re: will bitcoin continue to rise,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.msg61933258#msg61933258,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.0

This is very difficult to answer, at the first place when you bought your Bitcoin, do you have any price target or goals like ""If Bitcoin reaches x price, I will sell""?
Because if you just want to sell it because it's already high, it seems you don't have plan at all but I am not against on it, if you want to take profits right now and that's your goal, go for it.",Re: will bitcoin continue to rise,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.msg61933268#msg61933268,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.0

 You read the situation well, dude. This issue of wanting to sell when the price of BTC is high makes some lose out on the opportunity to experience the beauty of holding because it's like they'd end up being losers if the price of BTC drops lower than the amount for which it was bought. That's why it's better to invest with an amount you can easily take your eyes away from.
 Currently, the price of Bitcoin is at 27,407 and we all hope for more increase and just like others have opined, we are sure to see a somewhat steady rise in it's price. As it is, reputable financial institutions are going under and I'm certain this could push more investors to look to Bitcoin thereby causing an increase.",Re: will bitcoin continue to rise,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.msg61933450#msg61933450,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.0

One of the things that is very difficult to say for sure is the future price, and the answer that will be given will still be ambiguous. if people know for sure that bitcoin price will reach $50k, then i think people will panic to buy bitcoin immediately.
However, we are all optimistic about the high price of bitcoin in the future. there's been some speculation about it, particularly the halving. however, that does not mean it is a sure thing. people can explain their speculation in full, but it is not necessarily accurate. we must be optimistic that the price of bitcoin will be very high in the future. after that, you need to make your decision to invest in bitcoin or not because you will bear all the risks yourself.",Re: will bitcoin continue to rise,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.msg61933485#msg61933485,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445341.0
