Well the whole post would make sense if you just remove that phrase altogether and not try to give fake ""free speech"":

Awesome! 

One point though; I think that you should remove ""uninteresting"" since that is completely subjective and there is no way an honest post can avoid it (readers determine interest, not the poster).

I agree about no referral codes (except perhaps in the signature if not intentionally used as the main message like using a large and bold font or huge image).

After all, most new bitcoin options (pools, exchanges, vendors, etc.) are largely discovered by posts here.

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

I don't think this forum needs registration date elitism. People already have enough excuses to insult and fallaciously disregard other people's arguments. We don't need people to think that the points of idiots are more valid or truthful just because they've been her awhile and we don't need people to think that new people are idiots and their opinions shouldn't be acknowledged just because they're new.

Jesus. This forum is scaring me. Usually, I'm the wackadoo on any particular forum, but lately I've been reluctant to post because I've been out-crazied. You know that you're insane when you see a hobo with crap-ridden pants backing away from you slowly.

Also, anyone who is ragging about free speech and censorship needs to understand that those principles don't apply in internet forums any more than they apply to me if I take a sharpie to your apartment walls. Those are governmental concepts. This forum is not run by the government. You have no right to free speech here only so much as they can't censor based on a user's characteristic of being part of a special group (E.G., you can censor me for being gay if I'm posting about bitcoins within guidelines that apply to non-gays).

This isn't even specifically about moderating offensiveness or spam, but relevance. Deleting someone's thread that says ""Sell sell sell"" is no different, in terms of free speech, from deleting a thread I might make featuring the entirety of the amino acid sequences for trypsin family proteases compared between various key animals so we might talk about concerted evolution with nary a mention of bitcoins.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg256528#msg256528,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .


These all sound reasonable to me, harmful but reasonable, number 1 is the most likely to be harmful to building the character of a robust community.

I can see any number of posts that would be worthwhile and add to the character of this forum (to any forum) yet would fall foul of many of these caveats.

For instance swearing is so culturally divisive that what might be seen as a genuine transgression by one person is simply humor (or more precisely 'humour') to another. From personal experience I know that - for example - Americans are can be offended by language that people from the UK are indifferent to, or even see as endearing, what to one person imbues a post with spirit and character to another renders it offensive.

But of course nobody wants to have to 'listen' to someone hurling unnecessary and unwarranted abuse at another poster, so there is a real need to keep a check on this kind of thing, at least to some degree.

I suggest you make a distinction between swearing per se and ad hominem, for example here are two examples . . .

A) Oh, for fuck's sake I can't believe they've increased their fucking charges for THE SECOND TIME in a freaking month! This is really starting to piss me off, they are just going to drive business elsewhere . . . (and so on)

B) It's clueless people like you who think you know it all, running around like some kind of genius telling everyone who will listen how great you think you are. Yet time after time you get it wrong and end up with the whole forum laughing at the sorry spectacle you have become, mostly through your own stupidity . . . (and so on)

. . . example A contains swearing yet is (to these ears at least) not in the least bit offensive, example B is pure ad hominem, likely to elicit a similar response and is corrosive to the conversation.

If on the other hand there is simply going to be a list of censored words then why not just use the BB software to track and change them, much like a US religious forum, so 'shit' becomes 'poopy' - and 'no fucking way!' becomes 'no damn way'.

Personally I think this kind of thing is a move in the wrong direction, I am a member of a cycling forum in the UK that has zero moderation and the tone and sense of community is something even the best drawn up list of rules could not come close to, the forum has grown from nothing to 50,000 + and suffers none of the problems lists of rules like these seek to address.

It's fucking great !

I agree with everything you have said so far. ""useless"" posts would very much be decided based on opinion. If there is going to be moderation, I would say limit it to the MOVING of posts to off topic and what not. Perhaps even make a ""trash bin"" where all the sailor mouthed people can hang out and throw fecal matter at each other.

There's no constitutional requirement for free speech in forums, but the principles are still important in some form if you want a workable forum. While forum moderators may technically have the right to moderate arbitrarily, it's basically impossible to have a meaningful discussion or trust the forum threads to actually represent the opinions of the users in any way whatsoever if they abuse this. Worse still it's impossible to tell when they are abusing it as an outsider, so at the slightest whiff of dubious moderation you basically have to assume all discussions are tainted.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg258011#msg258011,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

Section one asks us to keep our posts calm and polite, but here we see people who are against these new rules labeled as 'ideologues' and dumped in the same bucket as 'trolls' and 'spammers' - and are invited to go elsewhere and swim in an ocean of shit.

I don't mind moderation, when done in, well, moderation. I do mind when I cant judge whether the mods are doing their jobs well or not. I can't judge for myself if I agree a thread was out of line if it's been deleted.

Mods, if you feel you need to shut a thread down, why not just lock it? Some other forums feature a ""trash bin"" section where ""deleted"" threads go, still available to read, but not cluttering the main forums. Maybe this would be something to look into here?

Can anyone give a good reason why deleting a thread would be preferable to just locking it, absent legal reasons and other force majeure?

A lot of times, deleting threads rather than moving them is harder on the database as well. So there's that benefit.

However, I think the idea of just moving threads that you and others have suggested is great. But a trash bin is just as bad as deleting. People post bullshit so that others will read it. Nobody reads threads in the trash bin.

Having a specific ""no rules"" subforum has worked for a lot of big forums, and ones much rowdier than this one (Somethingawful has FYAD, 4chan has /b/, Offtopic has, well, I guess the main forum). If you give the idiots a specific place to play and call their own, they won't make irritating posts in other forums as often. Just make a forum with no rules except what is obviously illegal and let people post to their heart's content.

Your original response to my post in support of the OP can be summarized as ""many of the people supporting sirius' rules are hypocrites, because they're the ones who've been breaking these rules in the past"".

The 'in the past' part is an insertion, but, yes, generally that's the point being made, whilst perhaps not hypocritical (it seems like too strong a term) those in favour of the new rules are in danger of falling foul of those new rules as much as the 'ideologues' they seek to drive out of the forum.

Honestly, I fail to see how that's a valid argument in support of keeping this forum unmoderated.
It's not an argument, it's only supportive of an argument, it's only illustrative of a point.

The point is that setting in place limitations that people might find themselves casually in breach of (and here the point that some of those most vocal in their support are themselves culprits becomes illustrative) might have (my own opinion is 'will likely have') consequences that will do more to stymie a healthy and robust community spirit than a more laissez faire approach (but of course not giving free reign to naked abuse).",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg266860#msg266860,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

Not much, I'm afraid. It is up to the users to resolve disputes, and it's up to the individual readers to determine for themselves who they think is right.

Previously I have argued that this forum should remain as free as possible.    However, now I'm forced to re-consider my opinion.  I believe that we should be giving more power and discretion and trust to the moderators in this forum.

I believe that there is nothing more dis-hearting that limiting the powers that the mods have, yet still expecting them to carry out an effective job.

Overall the question boils down to 'do we trust the moderators or not’ I for one certainly do.  They have shown time-after-time to be very reliable and level headed.  Allowing the moderators to ban accounts, see the IP address, move and delete stupid topics, and the whole host of standard moderation powers would make this forum far better.  It also would be a vote of confidence in those doing the good work already.

@theymos, I really hope you can choose to empower your moderators, otherwise they will lose heart and you will not have any quality ones anymore.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg495619#msg495619,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

Make a public viewable Trashcan board in Other so that mods can move all trash-topics to the trashcan.
The trashcan board should be locked for users to reply, only readable.
Helps to educate users and prevent more garbage, users can see what undesirable content is.

And if you want the board to be more serious you can create a ""Humor"" section so mods don't have to trash these, but just move to this board.

Being free and libertarian is good and all but allowing a platform to trolls who frequently make callous, vicious, and mean spirited attacks between members is ridiculous.  The forum should accept that there is a big difference between being heavy handed and the middle way response of promoting mature, rational, and responsible behavior on the board.  To not do that, in my opinion, is irresponsible and harms bitcoin.

Thanks for your input.  And note, if you will, that ""callous, vicious, and mean spirited"" is entirely subjective.  Subjectively, ""in my opinion, is irresponsible and harms bitcoin"" in reference to the style of moderation that the establishment has chosen to promote, could be interpreted exactly the same way.  Just because your not cursing, doesn't change this perspective.  And yet, you will not find a single mod here that would censor yourself over this opinion about us.  Manners would be a grand thing to have, but some members don't, and we simply couldn't force manners even if we had the time.  If you feel strongly about this, I recommend that you start another forum, with rules of your own liking, and invite a few of the early adopters to participate.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg502953#msg502953,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

> 1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner.
Goes without mentioning, is self evident, any communication violating this rule is void.
Ok ""relevant"" and ""calm"" as well as ""polite"" are open to be discussed.
But this is a 90% to 10% or rather 99% to 1% issue. Just making up some numbers:
Of 1% being ""censored"" let there be 1% wrongly accused. So what? Wait until these numbers get relevant.
I am absolutely sure this forum will safely sort that out with ease.
Definitely easier than sorting out the hassle without this rule.

> 2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
Difficult to decide where zero starts.
But I heavyly rely an mods with experience to handle such difficult questions with ease.

> 3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
Repeating 2. => same argument

> 4. No referral code spam
Makes life easier, posts have a number to refer to.
It is all written above, so leave it there. Repetitio non placet.
Be polite, don´t bore others.

> 5. No NSFW content
See 1. nothing really new here.

You can reduce the rules to:
Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner.
2. to 5. are redundant thus help explaining the idea.

I'm pretty happy with Bitcoin Discussion in general, and most others are I think. There's a few threads that are annoying but overall it works out well.

If the replies are taking the thread off track, that's a separate issue and isn't solved by just moving the thread, and a thread shouldn't be moved just because of the replies.

Interesting policy. I consider pure bump posts very very rude. If I can't make up any """"""news"""""", I don't bump my threads.

If bumping is all fine with the mods, could you please introduce a checkbox ""bump up once per day"" so I can bump it without cluttering it with ""/bump"" posts?

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

A step in a wrong direction. Now moderators will decide which posts have ""low value"", which posts are ""uninteresting"" or ""pointless"". In practice moderators will delete everything they don't like. The words ""free speech"" above are thus an obvious lie.


Completely agree. I think the moderator is on a power trip and definitely giving more favor to larger companies. I asked the moderator  in the general discussion to please clarify why some service announcements are allowed (eg. Dentist accepting Bitcoin, Bitpay announcements, etc.) and others are moved to the services announcement page.

My request to clarify post was promptly moved to the ""other/meta"" thread. lol. I think there's a kickback system going on here. I will be starting a reddit post to try to give this more attention. New services are being shutout at the discretion of the moderator.

The fewer rules the better.     If you don't need the rule to have a chat with a few friends, why should a forum need it?    Forums, where the furniture police have set out 100+ rules are not a pleasure to participate in.

You want civility,  on-topic adult discussion with minimal distraction,  and high signal  encouraged by deleting things that don't add potential value.

I do agree, that signatures which are long or contain graphical banners  or large images are distracting and don't add to discussion.

5. No NSFW content

I think this may ultimately give posters too much uncertainty about whether what they are writing down or linking to is OK or not,   and it may discourage conversations we'd otherwise see which would be no fun;  NSFW is a very broad brushstroke.

I see occasional threads popping up with ""NSFW"" in the conversation title.
Not that the conversation itself is,  but the link may be.

Perhaps the rule should be extended to say no NSFW content outside of tasteful (non-obscene) content in a thread with (NSFW) in the title.
(Although that would not fully address.)


What some people view as NSFW varies, also;  in some workplaces just porn / pictures a coworker might happen to see are the line between personal use of employer resource's  and unacceptable usage (NSFW)....

Other workplaces are particularly strict, AND mere loading of a page with sexist or dirty jokes,  sexually suggestive chatter- just plain text,  Bitcoin itself,  or any sort of unprofessional subject matter  may be unsafe topics.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg6027360#msg6027360,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

Although it is awesome to see new coins come out and have a flood of one word interest.  For example cryptocasino the first proof of risk concept, had pages of one word support (share requests) and entire thread was deleted and his account was banned.
   This could be damaging to new coins as im not certain the rules of the forum are clearly defined and might hinder free response of excitement.

4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

Posting ""interested"" in three different threads is not adding anything to the discussion like you did as seen in your post history.

You can let them know by other means:

- you can rent ad slots on this forum - https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=731988.0
- you can pay people to put a link to your site or thread in their signatures
- you can PM people that have elsewhere on the forum recently voiced interest in paying for services similar to yours

Asking to join, asking for an opinion, ""special"" offers - doesn't matter. Don't PM them unless you have a very good reason to suspect whoever you're PM'ing is going to be interested.

Quote
At least there should be something on the user's account saying for instance ""No spam!"" or some other warning.

It works the other way around, if they specifically say ""PM me"" in their signature or personal text field or somewhere else, or otherwise indicate they're interested (e.g. by looking for advice which cloud services they could use), then it is OK to PM them.

The activity number is determined in this way:
time = number of two-week periods in which you've posted since your registration
activity = min(time * 14, posts)

Activity is updated every hour.

The new membergroup limits work like this:
Group Requirement
Brand New 0 posts
Newbie (none)
Jr. Member activity: 30
Member activity: 60
Full Member activity: 120
Sr. Member activity: 240

Not suitable/safe for work (NSFW) is Internet slang or shorthand. Used as a warning next to web links that go to a web page with images or video that wouldn't be appropriate for workplace viewing (pornography, naked or near-naked people, graphic photos, etc.)

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.

5. No NSFW content

It would be physically impossible to check everyone.

It would depend on the context in my opinion.
That said a long post to get to the point of +1 would likely include some sort of opinion or reasoning to why you agree/disagree with it.

Since you posted a question posts one as well curious on the referral link
If there was a competition going on say the World Cup and you posted in the gambling forum a link to the gamble with a referral link in it would that count as referral spam or a legitimate gambling post. (Throws in a second condition or if you created that bet and wanted others to join in and posted it in gambling) E.G Since the forums focused on the Greek Crisis some sort of Greek bet on if they leave the EU Stay in it etc, or a dedicated bettors thread with ref links and different bets being posted by different people.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg11875265#msg11875265,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

 It is not slander if it is true. I am sorry that you have psychological issues and that you are offended that I am calling you out on it in public. I honestly believe this to be your issue, and I hope you get treatment. The negative trust rating was not appropriate either BTW.

Does the word, credibility, mean anything to you ?

The fact that you were removed from the forum's default trust, is in itself, a damn good reason to leave you negative trust.

His post and others where he has repeated these sentiments, have not been deleted .

Does today's deletion imply that I/we should tolerate racism ? This would be understandable had I dwelled on it. Or maybe this mod failed to see how I replied by editting the original post.

put off-topic threads into the suitable forums, instead of just deleting, so that the people will understand.
regulate zero value threads harsher in this ""bitcoin discussion"" session in order to prevent encouragement of spamming, however, if those zero value threads' contents in which a certain forum would be the most suitable for them, take those thread into those suitable forums, instead of banning and/or deleting.

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

what do you mean by this statement, do you have BTC? if so, how many and where do you keep them?  did you like the Nazi's? you mentioned gestapo....i was just playing with you and i realize it is a pretty useless reply, but sometimes you gotta loosen up a bit.

there are way too many threads on here to really stick them all in one category of ""probing"" or ""scamming"" or ""phishing""

sometimes i hit the forum here just to read about the tech and what people are doing with the same code to produce new effects.


think about the original satoshi code, nothing in that set of scripts was new or is new, crypt hashes and cracking them, network protocols sending to multiple ""servers"", storing the full data in the stream and on all servers was a little new, but much like the way that the cell carriers first started moving sms and email data....all mundane boring bits of code that had been used for years, combined with the virtual currency thing, which never caught on with the social sites other than within the site itself, mix it all together and it created a brand new completely self-contained, self-reliant and even self-updating of sorts system of security and currency creation and exchange. 

and now, look what people have done with that original concept and code, new forms of crytpo, new algorithms forms and a brand new way of doing business that will one be the main form of currency whether each person likes it or not, all from a handful of separate boring code libraries

i even think some of these altcoin/community based currencies have breached new forms of self-enhancing commerce, where bitcoin was and is a pretty straight forward, value based commodity for open trade.

it is like looking at the world and only seeing the bad stuff, this forum has some pretty annoying people, pretty useless and annoying threads and some downright evil people straight up using it to steal from others, but there are also new concepts that would have never been found if not for the thinktank conversations that a forum of this size and nature can produce., just saying",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg15096332#msg15096332,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

There is no fixed answer to that question. There is no exact ""policy"", nor can there be a policy that is good enough for determining spam/low quality posts. Easy examples of posts that get answered are posts that contain only emoticons, a good amount of posts that contain only 1 word (e.g. ""watching""), posts that contain only insults (without any other input), etc. This is definitely not a ""sick policy"". This is a privately owned forum, and as such can enact any set of rules that the owners decide on.

Correct. And your post is spam, clearly.
But then you know that. You are an expert in this field.
Any reason you post spam? Well writing multiple posts per day on multiple farmed accounts is time consuming i guess.

Your account is part of the 400ish farmed accounts i have listed here, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1597201.180

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

Guidelines are normal. These guidelines are very easy to follow.... and yes thank you for giving freedom to post here on BTC.

No messages, its about posts and time. Everything over one post in time will not increase your activity and thus not your rank.

Thanks. Nah, not worth it (and the thread itself would risk getting deleted I guess). Looking at the rules the only one it could possibly be would be #1, which seem quite subjective. I get deleting obvious spam, but beyond that, subjective guidelines enforced in a non-transparent fashion is not a great mechanism. With wikis there's usually some means of seeing the moderation.

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.

<...> Posts over 65535 bytes get cut off at 65535 bytes. If that makes the BBcode invalid in certain ways, then you get the INVALID BBCODE error.

Also, note that a byte is different from a character. Because SMF stores ""special"" characters in a particularly space-inefficient way, each Russian character uses about 6 bytes, and each line break also uses 6 bytes.

me for telling you that.  Whether you agree with it or not, those kinds of posts that
might fly on other discussion forums won't fly here.  Either add something substantial
to a thread or don't add anything.

you who are reading this, if you see a post like the one above that's an obvious shit
post, report it.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg23391933#msg23391933,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

Who says you have to post junk? All you would have needed was to make 30 posts over 3 activity periods and you would be a Junior Member. Activity reflects how active you have been, not merely how long you have been registered here. If that was the case, anyone could just buy an old hacked account and suddenly claim to be a long-time member without any posts or contributions, but that's why the activity system is there in the first place and is actually a fairly good system (though of course people can game or abuse it).",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg23422595#msg23422595,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

I just posted about a topic whether Bitcoin will be replaced or not and it got deleted. ""There will be competitors but to replace, it will be difficult."" 



I have reported several topics that have been deleted.  This is not an issue of free speech.  This is an issue about speaking the language of the forum at hand well enough to make a point that is of legitimate substance.  Too many on this forum cannot do this even with Google translate helping them.  In other words if you post nonsense moderators will delete it or other members will report it to be deleted via the discretion of moderators.


Example...even though your sentence technically properly formed in English, it is nonsense.  It registers in the mind as if I was to type asdfjk;/ asdfjkl'; asdfjk; asdfjk;l;/ asdfjkl;.  Most that know how to type can figure out where I get the pattern too.  Just because they can understand it doesn't make it any less irrelevant to any given topic unless someone is asking for typing patterns.

I don't think the moderators want a forum here called ""Look at me!  I can write in (barely) comprehensible complete English sentences!!""

But that is all most of so many people on this forum are doing.  Nonsense aka shitposts are pushing users of this forum to crack down on it once it really spirals out of control.  I live in a country where people who barely speak English ask me about doing BTC campaigns.  I tell them ""NO!"" since I know where they will end up spewing nonsense.

How difficult would it be to implement a voting system for posts using the current forum software?

That would lead to  a large scale of moderation which would limit free speech as opposed to nudging posts towards civility and relevant content with a given group.

I still believe that the large pools should have their own subgroups
The forum moderation policy is very good. One point though; I think that you should remove ""uninteresting"" since that is completely subjective and there is no way an honest post can avoid it (readers determine interest, not the poster).  I think that ""pointless"" covers it well and is much more objective within the context of a group and easily covers ""intentionally uninteresting.

1) Your reply that ""we are not in or at school"" shows that you, yourself, do not understand even complex explanations or analogies, further strengthening the argument for why the mods must be strict to eliminate incomplete statements or utter nonsense.

2)  I don't care what you think about my abilities to teach.  I was giving an example as to what is considered acceptable vs. unacceptable in the English speaking portion of the world and what is considered of high standards...standards that the moderators are trying to enforce to lend credibility to this forum that is otherwise becoming unreadable because of shitposters.

3) Who fights for this?  People whose English sucks?  If you cannot write in English at a reasonable level, stick to your native language forum.  This is a no-contest no-brainer.

Be careful when talking about retards....most people posting on these forums probably have an IQ near that level....so in this case it's the MODS protecting the majority of the readers that do not post.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg24803669#msg24803669,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

Ask your questions in your native language forum if your English is not at a solid conversation level.  English is my 2nd language but I've spent most of my life practicing it.  That said, I don't blame the moderators one bit for banning what comes across as nonsense.  Ironically I can read between the lines of the nonsensical English that I come across but it gives me a splitting headache...and this is where so many have been complaining for the mods to take action.  You might be able to read English perfectly well but if you are posting while translating in your head that's where everything goes wrong.  Just post in your native forum and be patient.  An answer will come if you are persistent.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg24814907#msg24814907,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content
Awareness about bitcoin is increasing on the internet, and more bitcoiners are coming everyday. It's about to completely get out from the dark, so, a new policy should be introduced. Nevertheless. there are still some bitcoiners who don't know how to use it, and basically they stop using it eventually. So a new policy should be introduced about not using your account for some time.

I would prefer a full on blanket ban on them to be honest, though I think they're fine in signatures. If people are making low quality posts then they should be dealt with regardless of whether they have a ref code in their signature. However, sometimes they can be useful for companies.

If one looks at what the whole of what you wrote above, the only thing of substance is that you are basically saying ""I agree"".  Everything else you wrote is basically irrelevant to the subject.

In most discussion forums and I'm 99% certain it's also the case here, bumping or saying ""I agree"" is the most fundamental form of spam or otherwise a tactic to increase post count.

There is no limit or requirement on the number of posts or the number of words in them in the forum rules. People get banned for posting irrelevant uninteresting posts just to increase their post count.

Allowing only one post is overkill. We have the Activity system in place to prevent abuse so you can't spam your way through ranks.

Awesome! 

One point though; I think that you should remove ""uninteresting"" since that is completely subjective and there is no way an honest post can avoid it (readers determine interest, not the poster).  I think that ""pointless"" covers it well and is much more objective within the context of a group and easily covers ""intentionally uninteresting"".

Yes, agree. We really Appreciated and we thank for consideration. Sometimes our post  has been deleted even though it is related to the topic.

Just because it is related to the topic doesn't make it relevant or important. Stating an answer that has already been given is pointless and should be removed even if you put some effort into the answer.

It's not unethical if you actually wrote it.

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""

In what way do you find it difficult to participate in discussions? What you must do is to look for those threads that you really want to join and it's on your interest. Don't comment to a topic that you really don't know and you don't have interest of knowing what that topic is all about.

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

And for posts, i guess it would be much better if there is a standard minimum of number of characters before it can be posted on a discussion..  . I mean that would extremely lessen the spams and ""zero-valued posts"" right??

That's the moderation policy and is only a tiny subset of the rules.

Have a read of them and I'm sure you'll find which rule you broke (rules 1, 4 and 33 are the most common). That would be the only reason you were banned.

Also, this rule should be interesting to you.

25. Ban evasion (using or creating accounts while one of your accounts is banned) is not allowed.

That's why your current account is likely to get banned as well.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg32893712#msg32893712,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""

3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.

4. No referral code spam

5. No NSFW content


. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .


These all sound reasonable to me, harmful but reasonable, number 1 is the most likely to be harmful to building the character of a robust community.

I can see any number of posts that would be worthwhile and add to the character of this forum (to any forum) yet would fall foul of many of these caveats.

For instance swearing is so culturally divisive that what might be seen as a genuine transgression by one person is simply humor (or more precisely 'humour') to another. From personal experience I know that - for example - Americans are can be offended by language that people from the UK are indifferent to, or even see as endearing, what to one person imbues a post with spirit and character to another renders it offensive.

But of course nobody wants to have to 'listen' to someone hurling unnecessary and unwarranted abuse at another poster, so there is a real need to keep a check on this kind of thing, at least to some degree.

I suggest you make a distinction between swearing per se and ad hominem, for example here are two examples . . .

A) Oh, for fuck's sake I can't believe they've increased their fucking charges for THE SECOND TIME in a freaking month! This is really starting to piss me off, they are just going to drive business elsewhere . . . (and so on)

B) It's clueless people like you who think you know it all, running around like some kind of genius telling everyone who will listen how great you think you are. Yet time after time you get it wrong and end up with the whole forum laughing at the sorry spectacle you have become, mostly through your own stupidity . . . (and so on)

. . . example A contains swearing yet is (to these ears at least) not in the least bit offensive, example B is pure ad hominem, likely to elicit a similar response and is corrosive to the conversation.

If on the other hand there is simply going to be a list of censored words then why not just use the BB software to track and change them, much like a US religious forum, so 'shit' becomes 'poopy' - and 'no fucking way!' becomes 'no damn way'.

Personally I think this kind of thing is a move in the wrong direction, I am a member of a cycling forum in the UK that has zero moderation and the tone and sense of community is something even the best drawn up list of rules could not come close to, the forum has grown from nothing to 50,000 + and suffers none of the problems lists of rules like these seek to address.

It's fucking great !

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

I mean, I am all up for this. It's difficult for the moderators and admins to maintain the forums, especially when there are lots of contents that are only made to add a post whether for their requirements in campaigns or to rank up their membership. However, I may also add that it's just a bit too indiscriminate sometimes because I have personally experienced about three even four of my posts being erased when I always ensure that the contents of my reply are on point plus the topics I select are those considered ""hot"" or reply-filled threads. So, sometimes, I ask myself, what is their rating to delete a post or thread, I just feel that sometimes it's too subjective.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg34985234#msg34985234,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

This is the job of the moderators and staff to clean out the forum from unwanted posts, topics and discussions.

If you didn't received a notification that you post is deleted then it only means that the whole thread you posted was moved to the trashcan.

How is the value of a post evaluated?


This is all about QUALITY. If we want to have posts to qualify to a certain standard, we must have measures for that.

So how we get those measures, who has them?
The answer is: no one, because post's quality measures actually should be an agreement between forum members. In respect of the forum posts, we need:

1) A standard of LOW-NORMAL-GOOD-EXCELLENT quality post.
2)  How we define them (measures). 

If that quality standard for forum posts is described clearly enough in the forum guidelines, everyone should be able to assess the quality/value of their posts.
And if someone goes against the forum culture, moderators will stop them.

All in all, without clear, but short descriptions of what is acceptable and what is not in forum posts, people continue to wonder, why their posts get removed sometimes.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg37469920#msg37469920,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

The first thing you need to do is stop using bold and colour in your posts like that or most people here will simply put you on their ignore list.

Which board your posts belongs in depends on exactly it is you are trying to promote. The Bitcoin and Altcoin sections are separate so it needs to go in the correct one. What do you mean by 'platform'? Is it hardware or a service? If it is cloud mining then forget about promoting it all together.

Your signature space is the only place you can put referral links. If you put them in your posts then your posts will get deleted.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg37762766#msg37762766,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

Tip for new users. Do not write short messages. They are deleted. To prevent messages from being deleted, you must write long messages. My messages, which consisted of 10 words, were deleted. Activity = 0.

Depends on context Perhaps we can get a good post / bad post mod up and running to do the job.

There is this development I beginning to notice in this our beloved platform,so many restrictions and most times are so so annoying the other time I replied a post to a brother constructive post and after which the account got blocked that made me feel so bad because I have had that account for so long,an account I created way back so months early last year it was a painful experience because I never expected it to happen that way.

I start feeling uneasy. A couple of weeks ago I posted here wondering why the thread I begun was deleted, as well as another post elsewhere. And today I find that the same happened with another thread I started yesterday.

Do you want the details? The first thread of some weeks ago was about how the Korean government started using blockchain for their own purposes. I was deeply baffled when I saw it deleted, while value-less new comments about e.g. Satoshi's identity stay.
An acquaintance explained to me that it was probably because I mentioned governments.
If this was the reason, then this sounds to me as if a forum for atheists should not mention the topic ""god"".

Even more disappointing, another message I wrote on that same day disappeared and I can't imagine why. (Can I guess that the mod who did't like my thread also deleted the message as extra punishment?)

And today? I started a thread discussing the new Metronome coin and its unusual sale strategy. I even got replies. What was my sin here? Is a decreasing price sale more meaningless than the n-th post about how great or horrible BTC is without any argument, or often without any grammatical structure? Was my sin the fact that I mention I'll buy some Metronome?

Earnest replies appreciated. I'm a noob on the forum trying to discuss what I deem to be serious questions and points, because this is how I view this whole story.

This is a bitcion forum. If it was a thread merely about blockchain tech used by the Korean government in Bitcoin Discussion then that's probably why it was trashed. Unless it's related to bitcoin then it'll be trashed or moved into the appropriate sub.

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

A step in a wrong direction. Now moderators will decide which posts have ""low value"", which posts are ""uninteresting"" or ""pointless"". In practice moderators will delete everything they don't like. The words ""free speech"" above are thus an obvious lie.


I agree with most of what @unemployed has mentioned, which is also repeated in numerous other posts in this thread, on the principle of terms being vague or non-specific and solely subject to individual interpretation. Words like ""pointless"" or especially ""uninteresting"" are completely subjective and therefore subject to any particular moderators personal feelings, mood, or selective scrutiny.

Also some rule categories are mixed within the same numbered points for example:


1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is...  <-- Mixed in other rules that are unrelated to the concept of Free Speech.  

2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL"" <-- Strike out, ought to be grouped with/covered by 4.

3. No pointless or uninteresting threads. <-- Covered by 2.

4. No referral codes spam; <-- except in signature (for example)

5. No NSFW content <-- Covered by 1, if drafted correctly (currently 1 includes like minded rules mixed in with ""Free Speech"" making it a contradiction in terms).

=========== Partial Proposed Revisions ===========

I'm not going to propose a rewrite for each of these 1-5, but just add on here for clarity. I believe my post makes the intended point about being more succinct in the rulemaking, not lengthier but specific.

1. Free Speech - Every member has an equal right to express their opinion regardless of forum rank without being subject to removal, harassment, or other derogatory statements.

2. No zero value posts or threads. -    , like ""SELL SELL SELL""   If the post does not add value to the topic, or is off topic, then it is considered spam.

3. ...   Remove, this is covered thoroughly by 2. People know, or will learn, when their post does not ""Add Value"" and this is not as subjective as ""uninteresting"" currently stated in the existing 3 (which has no relevance).

4. No referral codes except in signature. As stated above.

5. No NSFW content Too subjective and non-specific. Replace with rules that over rule all others, i.e., Hate speech of any kind, harassment of other members or coins/projects, spamming incl. cross referral selling, will NOT be tolerated and members posting in this manner may be subject to immediate ban.

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

A step in a wrong direction. Now moderators will decide which posts have ""low value"", which posts are ""uninteresting"" or ""pointless"". In practice moderators will delete everything they don't like. The words ""free speech"" above are thus an obvious lie.

The moderators are experts and i believe they know what post have low value,uninteresting and pointless so is a step in good direction.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg43267608#msg43267608,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

I never considered going back, so when the ranks of everyone without merit was changed to newbie,

it means nothing to me.


Now I understand that the ""elders"" of bitcointalk want to stop ""spam"" messages of signature campaigns from

flooding your threads But when you do these blanket actions that effect members that had nothing to do with this signature

spamming it only confirms the decisions of a lot of members like me to ignore the forums totally and focus on the bounties .

I will give credit to the bitcoin talk members that are fighting against scam ICO's.  


I do go to the scam accusation thread  daily to make sure I dont promote scam ICO's.  The one time I was tagged with Neg

Trust  for promoting a scam ICO I read the  rules made the required changes and the neg trust was removed.  

I understand your need to stop ""spammers"" but there has to be a better way. Bitcointalk has to become

Now I understand that the ""elders"" of bitcointalk want to stop ""spam"" messages of signature campaigns from

flooding your threads But when you do these blanket actions that effect members that had nothing to do with this signature

spamming it only confirms the decisions of a lot of members like me to ignore the forums totally and focus on the bounties .
Those that have nothing to do with ""spam issues"", won't/shouldn't be affected in anyway (I'm amazed at the frequency of users complaining for a single merit, in such a short time)...

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

A step in a wrong direction. Now moderators will decide which posts have ""low value"", which posts are ""uninteresting"" or ""pointless"". In practice moderators will delete everything they don't like. The words ""free speech"" above are thus an obvious lie.

Don't like it either.  Deleting what you don't like doesn't make it useless. Readers are in best position to judge this not moderators. It could be 'interesting' and of 'high value' to readers but yet deleted.

Actually, it is really hard to pinpoint if a project is heading to be a scam at its early stage.
One way to check possible scam in the making is to visit the section- Scam Accusations Board (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?board=83.0)
Also, there are red flags that you can check - fake profiles, plagiarized papers, free website domains, and many more.

I'm hoping that this system will increase post quality by:
 - Forcing people to post high-quality stuff in order to rank up. If you just post garbage, you will never get even 1 merit point, and you will therefore never be able to put links in your signature, etc.
 - Highlighting good posts with the ""Merited by"" line.

While we will not be directly moderating this, I encourage people to give merit to posts that are objectively high-quality, not just posts that you agree with.

Yes....

4.5 months minimum to earn the requisite minimum 120 activity points to be eligible to become full member, if any newbie member stays active with on average of about 1 post per day, and if that member also earns 100 merits during such time.

It may take many newbie members longer than 4.5 months to earn 100 merits, because it takes a while for other members to get to know such newbie members, and members will tend to merit more quality and contributory posts and sometimes will not send merits until they have seen a few good posts from newbie members... and sometimes if new members engage with other members about the topic of their post, those responsive posts are helpful and the posts are largely adding value to the thread or at least to some members who are paying attention, then the newbie member become more likely to earn merits from the attention that they had gotten from other members.

Probably, to earn merits, frequently it will help if newbie members are actually interested in the topics about which they post. Of course, having interest in the topic is not a pre-requisite, but frequently if such newbie member is interested in the topic, then they are more likely to provide value that is based on their knowledge, experience and/or excitement that might be useful to some other members, which could possibly inspire some members to send the newbie member some smerits.

P.s.  By the way, I personally tend to get turned off by any member (whether newbie or not) who refers to himself/herself in the royal ""we.""  Perhaps it is a pet peeve of my own in terms of not inspiring me to want to send any smerits to such a poster who uses that style of posting, even if s/he or it considers himself/herself or itself as part of a team... .. Of course, there could be exceptions of accounts that are really considered accounts of an organization rather than a person, and maybe that would be in the description of the account being an organizational account, but that just seems a bit strange to me in terms of effective ways to interact with an account in this forum and miachang's use of we:  ""How we can add our avatar?""... could have been just a language/culture issue, but still kind of triggers me, personally, in a negative way.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg54477676#msg54477676,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

It's not just about ""translated ICO announcements"". Pay attention to the following highlighted parts:

Quote from: hilariousandco on December 15, 2017, 09:52:28 AM
It is prohibited to create translated ICO threads for Local Languages that don't have their own sub boards. Due to abuse, it is also prohibited for users to create threads outside of their Local Thread. This sub forum is for those languages that don't have a local board to have their own thread to discuss bitcoin in; it is not a place for account farmers and spammers to easily abuse campaigns. If you post threads outside of your own local thread you will be banned.

The policy to not remove anything worked when the forum was small. Now that we have thousands of posts a day, we can't afford 50% of them being junk. The moderators are now instructed to be less tolerant of low-value posts.

Some guidelines:

1. Free speech - you can say anything as long as it is relevant and presented in a calm and polite manner. Swearing, SHOUTING etc. make your post more likely to be removed.
2. No zero value posts or threads, like ""SELL SELL SELL""
3. No pointless or uninteresting threads.
4. No referral code spam
5. No NSFW content

Unfortunately, that's not going to happen since scams aren't moderated in here, but you can ""create a flag [with enough support, it'll become active]"" and other users can tag that user for his/her actions...

Read the threads that you are interested in
Ask questions where you don't understand
Try to be specific in your questions
Just interact with the users like a normal human being
Have a decent post format

Do NOT spam : two letter posts ""good project"" ""very good""
Do NOT beg (crypto or merit)
Do NOT try to cheat, steal or diceive
Do NOT ask for ""no collateral loans"" as a newbie
Do NOT pretend to be satoshi

That's pretty much it in a nutshell. Not strict if you ask me, just normal",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg59326305#msg59326305,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

There's no Bitcointalk application, if your referring to an app which is on the apple store or Google store. The forum doesn't officially support the usage of mobile devices, although Simple Machines Forum, the software the forum is based on, is somewhat usable without a dedicated app.

There are third party apps which make the forum a little more intuitive, but as with anything third party, we wouldn't recommend them unless they were at least open source, and vetted by the community.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg59399709#msg59399709,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0

I have not seen a bitcointalk app before and i dont that the site have a designed application. You can only login the site the link and also through Google directions.

That would lead to  a large scale of moderation which would limit free speech as opposed to nudging posts towards civility and relevant content with a given group.

Hmm? This policy seems to be working for these boards for the past several years. You can say many things here without fear of censorship.

That would be too much. Sometimes it's enough to express what you're thinking in a couple of words. And who will control who wrote how many words? The moderators? How do you imagine that? That the moderators will have to count the number of words in every more or less long post?

Not sure what you mean exactly, but I'm assuming you're talking about a application for Bitcointalk on your phone? That doesn't exist. There's no officially supported application for either Android or Apple that supports logging in or using Bitcointalk on your phone. If you've got one installed then this is unofficial, that's a potential security risk if you've entered your credentials into them.

If you're talking about how to use Bitcointalk in general, i.e through the web interface. It's based on Simple Machine Forum (SMF) software, which you can read their wiki. However, do note some things are custom here, which you can usually find in sticky threads or the above help page.",Re: Forum moderation policy,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.msg61621521#msg61621521,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=20333.0
