When the price of Bitcoin drops a lot. Then I buy bitcoins with some of my savings. And tell my friends to buy some bitcoins too.  A few of my friends bought some bitcoins with me.

The Bitcoin market has been bearish for a long time.
Many then Many people are commenting on Bitcoin. I have some friends who used to criticize this bitcoin a lot. They were saying that the price of Bitcoin would never go up. Gradually the price will fall further. But I did not give up hope. I was so patient that the price of Bitcoin would go up I knew. And researched Bitcoin.

Now with me who was buying bitcoins. They are very happy. Their dreams have come true.

And those who criticized a lot. They are regretting it now.
Then I told them. It is not right to comment on something without researching it.  I have been doing a lot of research on Bitcoin. Then investing and asking others to do it.  Now they are showing a lot of interest in Bitcoin.

Take a lesson from here. That If someone wants to invest. Then do your own research. Never make bad comments about other people  And patience is the biggest thing. He who is patient will definitely get success.

Alright just make it simple, just post your Bitcoin address and sign a message to prove your ownership, otherwise you're lying and not telling the truth. The recent dump was at March 10, 2023 and November 10, 2022 - Early January, 2023, so must be bought Bitcoin at those date where Bitcoin was declining.

It is your money and it is your decision after your research. I congratulate you for your early or first success with your Bitcoin investment. However, let me send you a reminder. Getting profit in cryptocurrency market is easy, sometimes more easily than you think BUT protecting your profit and your capital in this market is MORE DIFFICULT.

Perhaps you have yet known about it and have yet experienced about it but time will help you understand.

But in your case they just happened to make some profit because the price shot up but what if they price went the opposite direction instead what would you have done?

OP just informed us that he has made some profit from the coins he purchased when the price was low and he is celebrating his success story. Yes, there was no news about the current mini-bull run but there are countless materials that predict the rise in the price of Bitcoin. Although many of these predictions are not precise but they always remind us to be patient and brave because hodling will always bring good news.

The current fall of some regional banks in the US and Switzerland ( Silicon Valley Bank and  Credit Suisse) might be the direct or indirect reason for the rise in the price of bitcoin. Maybe people are beginning to understand that banks cannot be trusted. The legendary American actress Sharon Stone recently revealed that she has lost half of her fortune in Silicon Valley Bank.

I am fed up with this kind of stories, which are a blatant attempt at merit fishing. When they are accompanied by evidence, like photos or screenshots, I can believe them, but not the kind of story the OP tells, unless it is accompanied by a signed message to back it up, as you say. In a Spanish forum that I visit, not signing a message to prove what he says could lead to a massive report and a ban, although in this one, which is so tough for certain things, this doesn't happen. This is with some exception, as the OP could claim that he has the bitcoins on Coinbase or some similar site and cannot sign a message.",Re: Bitcoin is the first success story,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445364.msg61933949#msg61933949,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445364.0

At this time it will require investors to have bigger amount to invest and hold until the price went high. If OP is able to hold bigger amounts means there is a chance he is able to earn a bigger return. But if not it will not be that much. Only those who are able to invest too early like early 2017 or later will be able to get much in bitcoin as the price is too low during those times.

After reading OP’s other topics regarding bitcoin investments, I’m more than certain this story was fabricated to fish merit from sentimental members. The OP was very vague in regards to when he bought the bitcoins, where he stored them and how long he kept the bitcoins. I have noticed threads like this tend to be all about how profitable bitcoin investments and what they have achieved with their profits.

If you manage to survive the bearish period then it will get a good profit, let your friend continue to criticize because he doesn't understand how the bitcoin cycle actually is so he keeps on commenting bad things about bitcoin that keeps saying negative things so I think friends like that don't need to be respond in the end he will regret how not to buy bitcoin when the price is down.

Whatever you do with this investment, of course there must be research done, not just because of FOMO or hype you buy bitcoin, but because you have to know and understand the bitcoin concept of movement in the market during bearish or rallying times.
There is no need to respond to other people's comments because after all we are enjoying this success ourselves and it is clear that long term investing in bitcoin will be better than any other investment.
