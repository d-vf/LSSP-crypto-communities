By just reading and scrolling here in the forum, I've seen a lot of different stories like they succeed and some loss a huge amount of assets. I conclude that it depends on

people's action in this industry whether they can profit big time or not. Of course as I saw successful experiences of other people I feel happy for them and congratulate them.

Those kinds of experiences inspires me and motivates me to have a wise decision sharing their thoughts would also help how can I also to be like them.

For me I don't feel late or delayed since you can still learn and keep up to the trends these days. If you always feel fomo it will just lead to bad decisions and losses in this

industry. Much better to learn more and explore more rather than rushing yourself in this industry, go learn have some knowledge and experiences first. And if I were in their

I am happy for people who can make money through BTC, but i do not want many people to feel that BTC investment is a means of making a fortune. If everybody shares stories of how they made fortunes through investing in BTC, we cannot even know if the stories are fake or true, but newbies would take it to be true and they may start investing with the hope of making a fortune, which may not happen, and they would not even attempt to learn a thing about BTC, which could make them lose their BTC.

I have my own story about Bitcoin)))

In 2015, my friend told me about the first cryptocurrency (Bitcoin).  We sat in a cafe with him and for three hours he drew a diagram of the Bitcoin blockchain on a napkin and talked about the various features of the first cryptocurrency (including colored coins).  I was impressed, although I understood little.  In the evening, lying in bed with my girlfriend, I told her about Bitcoin. 

However, he did not impress her.  She looked at me like I was an idiot and said that my friend and I are two fools.  Then I once again tried to figure out the prospects of Bitcoin myself and saw that the price of the first cryptocurrency was constantly falling. 

This convinced me that this was not the thing to be interested in. 

So I missed the opportunity to invest early in Bitcoin (it was then worth a couple of hundred US dollars). 

And then I broke up with this girl.",Re: How do you feel when people tells their story on bitcoin,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5444851.msg61912843#msg61912843,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5444851.0

Despite the fact that I am not as fortunate as an early adopter or big investor in bitcoin, I tend to feel grateful that I am here for bitcoin. I'm not as rich as they are, that's true because I'm not here with a strong economic background to be a big bitcoin investor.
