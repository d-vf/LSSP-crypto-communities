Many people are into crypto for materialistic things, like cars, houses, etc but the best Gift I have attained from Bitcoin investment is free time, to live my life, finally.

Bitcoin investment makes me feel alive once again, after so many years of a nonstop workaholic life, now I have enough time to think, travel, rest, go on holidays, spend time with families and still make more money than I used to when I was a workaholic.

Now I can do everything I have always wanted, time is not on anyone's side and if you spend all your days on some hard jobs working and working you won't notice how fast time is running and you will age so fast in the process.

I remember I got so sick after going from one job to another, I ended up spending a lot of money on my health, I got so thing and my immune system got drained too, you might end up making millions and spending half of that to get back in shape, always remember, health is wealth.

Whatever you do, make sure you live your life like someone who is truly alive and breathing, if you are in any hard jobs that's draining your life away right in front of your eye, you need to put a stop to it.

I want all the good flashy things in life but the best gift I have now is free time, and Bitcoin makes this possible, I don't know about others and I can't talk for others but, to me, Bitcoin is Freedom.",Time is the most valuable thing,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441514.msg61830423#msg61830423,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441514.0

too many people are in the ""rat race"" scurrying around trying to find scraps to survive on. working extra just to try to get some savings/pension.

in regards to many fiat elitists that have called bitcoin things like rat poison. they are correct too. its a complement. bitcoin kills off the 'rat race' style of economy and lets people have freedom from those rodents trying to nibble at everything you own

bitcoin when bought at the right times can help people sooner, and even if bought at the wrong times can help people later. whereby their reliance on ""normal"" employment of chasing for wealth endlessly, finds its end by no longer needing to chase it and instead receive it

i too reached that point many years ago where bitcoin gave me freedom so i know exactly how you are feeling right now, where you are coming to that point of now enjoying life

There are lot of things which we do but don't deserve taking much of our time because at the end of the day we only get little or no return from them,so why wasting time on less precious things, one of the reasons I can always go for Bitcoin is because it permits you to always have this time to reposition your life while investing on it, you can invest and left for some years without any dear of Bitcoin missing out, Bitcoin always permits you to have time for proper preparations over other things yet creating it value at maximum always.",Re: Time is the most valuable thing,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441514.msg61831438#msg61831438,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5441514.0

before I got to know bitcoin, I always tried and looked for a side income by doing any job after doing my main job to support my family.
To be honest, before getting to know bitcoin, at that time I was like the backbone of my family and everything I did and I did was to earn extra income. And at that time I was a car wash and at the same time selling cassava chips and other things that I can't mention, I did all that after I got home from work and also on holidays. And it's all just to get extra income that doesn't know time because my salary is less.
and after i was introduced to bitcoin from my friend, everything changed drastically and i just do my job and the rest i can hang out with my friends to have fun. And I can also get married with capital from bitcoin profits, and so on until now my life is very safe and comfortable, especially in financial matters, even the cost of giving birth is also because of bitcoin.

Some people believe that adopting the lifestyle of a workaholic will guarantee wealth, that is a wrong idea. People who invest time endlessly to the growth of a company will still not be retained when they are due for retirement. Time is important and you have to understand that just as you dedicate time to work, you should also dedicate time to learning and seeking valuable information that can help you work less and gain more.
