In a tweet on his personal account, Van Overtveldt stated that the crypto asset industry “does not bring any economic or social value.” CoinDesk reported that his comments were made as the EP prepares to vote on regulations regarding crypto activities.


“Another lesson to be learned from the current banking commotion. Enforce a strict ban on cryptocurrencies. Speculative poison and no economic or social added value. If a government bans drugs, it should also ban cryptos,” wrote Van Overtveldt.

He believes that banks are in crisis due to the impact of cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, the EU parliamentarian assumes that all cryptocurrencies are pure speculative assets and have no economic or social value. Van Overtveldt even compared cryptocurrencies to drugs.

If regulation is the cause of the banks that collapsed, they were unable to take care of fiat organizations which they strictly control, but he wants cryptocurrencies to be banned. Or how is crypto similar to banks or fiat?

Why can't he wants all banks to be banned because of the collapse?

If the banks' employee want to invest in crypto using their customers money, they need to know if crypto are mostly scam and of course they need to make sure to invest what they can afford to lose only. Banning the whole crypto including Bitcoin is a wrong decision because it's the fault from their employee for choosing a bad coin.

It's really funny how they always decide who to blame for their failed policies but never admit their own errors. 

Both financial systems serve their own purposes; the banks should function on their own with their government policies and regulations, and they should allow us to use our crypto. 

Even with the government having control over the banking sector, the banks are still experiencing bankruptcy.Maybe they also want to control cryptography and pilot it to failure.

They corner crypto as in their thinking people save more money in crypto than banks so that deposits in banks are shrinking, so they think that what causes the liquidity of money in banks is little.
Even though the main indication is that interest rates have risen to suppress inflation, even they also create inflation because they print too much money.

The current banking system is rotten and unsustainable. Without employing shady means, it simply can't last long. But when it finally collapses, the blame is directed at something else. They are quick to raise pointing fingers at alternatives. Rather than inward evaluation, they are quickly scanning for any disruptive force outside.

Speaking of drugs, a very common initiative or perhaps one of the main approaches to curb its spread here in my country is surprise drug testing. I can liken this to Van Overtveldt's absurdity.

Lol, these people have absolutely no idea how any of this work do they? I mean it is really funny to me that they would be considering to ban bitcoin at a time when many people are avoiding banks and going into bitcoin because they trust bitcoin more than they trust these banks.

I get that they want people to go back to banking, because that way there would be a lot of money in the banks and they wouldn't crash, that is what they believe in and that is why banning bitcoin makes sense for them. But the reality is that we are not going to see that happen because you can't ban bitcoin, you can ban the use of it, but you can't ban it because we will just use p2p and still continue.","Re: EU Lawmaker Johan Van Overtveldt Compares Crypto To Drugs, Calls For Ban",https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445357.msg61939266#msg61939266,https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5445357.0

If they can not successfully improve their bank system and fix it, they will have to find alternatives to indirectly protect their rotten bank system. They have to build up as many barriers as possible in order to prevent as many people changing from bank system to Bitcoin transactions or cryptocurrency transactions.

I don't think they will succeed completely but some people who naively belief in what they saw, what they heard will be against Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Some people in society will co-use bank system, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency because fact is we can not exclude bank transfers in our lives. Many activities and payments must be done by bank system.

Bank runs come and go and will return. Each time it will cause bank collapses but it won't change how society need bank and use it.
